00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,329
[Music]

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
so

3
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:28,240
[Music]

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,400
hi everyone this is karen hey everybody

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,238
i'm shane today we're looking at part

6
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:32,640
one

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,520
of surprising geography facts and the

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,280
vocabulary words are

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,160
recall recall from what i recall

10
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,200
colleen's dad

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,320
is a doctor rainfall rainfall

12
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,039
the area has an average rainfall of

13
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,239
around 30 centimeters per year

14
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,440
yearly yearly the town's summer festival

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,239
is held

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,600
once yearly primarily primarily

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,559
engine trouble was primarily responsible

18
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,719
for the plane crash

19
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,240
vast vest the library has a vast

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,200
selection of books to choose from so

21
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,360
we're talking about some

22
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,520
surprising geography facts yeah i think

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,560
this is kind of like

24
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,240
trivia right you're kind of learning

25
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,000
some interesting facts that maybe are

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,799
not that

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,280
useful in everyday life but they are

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,040
interesting and then they are about a

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
world so i think it's worth knowing

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
right and some are quite surprising so

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
the first one to

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,479
talk about is antarctica being

33
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,920
a desert and it is

34
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,720
it is the largest desert right yes not

35
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,360
only that's

36
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,159
the largest one but that seems really

37
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,360
strange because

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,960
when you think of a desert you don't

39
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,439
think of a place that's made of water

40
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,399
but actually the definition of a desert

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:50,880
it's

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,960
actually an area that receives less than

43
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,880
250 millimeters of rainfall

44
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,920
annually so yeah and they only have like

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,040
i think around 170 millimeters

46
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
of rainfall per year wow so

47
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,280
yeah it's in fact a desert i know

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,640
antarctica and then over in russia

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,599
they have 11 different time zones in one

50
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,160
country

51
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,200
because it is so big right

52
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,080
so that actually makes sense but it's

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,000
quite surprising you can call somebody

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,840
in russia at one point and then maybe

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,760
it's like the next day on the other part

56
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,959
of russia

57
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,640
usually think it should be the same time

58
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
zone in the same country

59
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,000
but even in canada is different time

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,080
zones too in america but we only have

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,239
three how many do you have i don't

62
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,680
remember i have to check

63
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,239
it's not 11. it's not 11. definitely

64
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,160
okay let's learn some more interesting

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,879
and surprising geography geography learn

66
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,840
geography facts

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
enjoy

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,560
surprising geography facts most of us

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
can recall some basic geography

70
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,040
knowledge

71
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
the highest mountain the deepest ocean

72
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,640
the biggest continent

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,599
etc but for some unexpected facts about

74
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,319
our planet

75
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,440
you'll have to read on

76
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,879
today's lesson is called surprising

77
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,959
geography facts part one

78
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,319
hello everyone my name is jeff and

79

geography class at school

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,239
when you recall something you remember

98
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,519

colleen's dad is a doctor

114
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,520
i remember meeting him one day and his

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,919
name's dr smith and he was telling us

116
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,560
about

117

working at the hospital it was five

118
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,479
years ago but yeah i recall that

119
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,680
i remember that i'm not bad anyways but

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,639
for

121
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,960
some unexpected facts about our planet

122
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,320
you'll have to read on

123
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,199
after a break we'll see you after the

124
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,000
break

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,320
hello

126
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,840
take out

127
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,800
geography facts antarctica is actually

128
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
the world's largest desert

129
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,639
you might think of sand and camels when

130
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,000
you hear the word desert

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,080
but a desert is officially defined as an

132
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,199
area that receives

133
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,199
under 250 millimeters of rainfall yearly

134
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,120
although antarctica is a continent

135
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,120
composed primarily of water

136
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,919
this water is locked in ice so with its

137
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:00,960
annual rainfall

138
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,600
at around only 170 millimeters

139
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,479
antarctica

140
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,400
easily falls within the definition of a

141
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,800
desert

142
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,800
okay fun geography facts and surprising

143
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,600
and surprising surprises first of all

144
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
the biggest desert in the world is in

145
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,039
africa it's called the sahara desert

146
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:23,520
right

147
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,160
yeah wrong antarctica

148
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,000
is actually the world's largest

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
desert yes you don't have to

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
have you don't have to have sand and

151
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,039
heat

152
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,240
okay and dryness to be

153
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,120
a desert the sahara desert is sandy and

154
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,639
dry and hot

155
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,280
and it's a really big desert but

156
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,160
antarctica

157
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,319
is also a desert and it's bigger than

158
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,199
the sahara

159
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,039
interesting but when you go to the zoo

160
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,720
they won't put the penguins with the

161
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,759
camels

162
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,240
because they're both desert animals that

163
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,160
would be weird that would not that would

164
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,960
not work out but it's true we don't look

165
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,199
at

166
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,520
we don't call it a desert because of all

167
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,680
the sand and all the hot sun

168
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,919
we call it a desert why because there's

169
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,880
no rain

170
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,919
well you might think of sand and camels

171
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,199
when you hear the word

172
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,560
desert most people do but a desert is

173
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,240
officially defined

174
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,319
as an area that receives under 250

175
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,440
millimeters of

176
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,160
rainfall yearly it's not about the

177
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,400
temperature it's not about the hot sun

178
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,759
and the hot sand

179
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,000
it's about rainfall and there's less

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,960
rainfall

181
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,080
in antarctica the south pole every year

182
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,240
than there is in the sahara what about

183
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,360
all the snow

184
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,400
and the ice and the blizzards and huh

185
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,240
it's been there forever it just never

186
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,840
goes away it's so cold

187
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,919
that's amazing anyways when we're

188
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,759
talking about rainfall we're talking

189
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,560
about

190
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,520
the amount of rain that falls in a

191
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,080
certain

192
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,240
area over some period of time okay

193
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,479
when i was growing up we actually had a

194
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,039
gauge outside of our house

195
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,759
okay and when it rained okay that would

196
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,280
fill up and it would tell us

197
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,919
how much it had rained during that

198
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,440
particular storm

199
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,639
if there was a lot of rain maybe one or

200
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:18,960
two

201
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,319
inches of rain fell over that entire

202
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,080
area that would that would have been a

203
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,280
lot of rainfall a lot of water

204
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,199
fell from the sky for example the area

205
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,880
has an average rainfall of around

206
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,640
30 centimeters per year oh okay

207
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,799
now this of course is a word we wouldn't

208
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,120
use in our daily lives when talking

209
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,240
about the weather

210
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
but on a weather report in a science

211
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,279
book

212
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,040
then they would use it but we wouldn't

213
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,720
say take your umbrella there will be a

214
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,480
lot of rainfall today

215
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,000
you wouldn't use it in that sort of

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,519
normal daily way

217
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,320
all right we also had this adverb yearly

218
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
when we talk about something that is

219
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
yearly or happens yearly or

220
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,959
occurs yearly we means it happens each

221
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,440
year

222
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,240
or in a year all right so we're just

223
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,720
talking about a year as a period of time

224
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,040
we're using that to measure things so

225
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,200
we're not saying in a decade or in a

226
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
century and a hundred years or in a day

227
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
or a week

228
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,360
in a year yearly for example the town's

229
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,519
summer festival is held

230
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,640
once yearly so once a year they have a

231
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,600
festival

232
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,640
okay now although antarctica

233
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,240
is a continent composed primarily of

234
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:34,959
water

235
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,760
something we would not associate with

236
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,839
deserts usually

237
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,279
this water is locked in ice

238
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,440
there you go here we have the adverb

239
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,800
primarily

240
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,640
primarily means for the most part so

241
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,920
yes this is a continent that is mostly

242
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,279
water it's composed or made up of water

243
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,279
for the most part or mostly

244
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,800
but the water is in the form of ice or

245
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,079
is locked in ice

246
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,440
so it's not

247
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,720
really water in the sense that

248
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,160
we think of water rainfall it's in

249
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,360
solid form it's not in the form of rain

250
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,720
it's composed primarily of water in ice

251
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,079
form and again primarily means mostly or

252
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,279
for the most part for example engine

253
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:27,839
trouble

254
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,600
was primarily responsible for the plane

255
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,079
crash

256
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,800
yeah the engine broke down and the plane

257
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,760
fell out of the sky

258
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,760
okay the pilots might have made a few

259
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,839
mistakes but they didn't have a lot of

260
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,640
time to fix things so if the engines

261
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
hadn't failed there wouldn't have been a

262
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,000
problem so let's look

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,800
at antarctica's rainfall remember less

264
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,480
than

265
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,800
250 millimeters yearly makes you

266
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,320
a desert so with its antarctica's

267
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,480
annual rainfall at around only 100

268
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,279
millimeters a little more than half that

269
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:03,920
number

270
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,800
antarctica easily falls within the

271
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,839
definition

272
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,920
of a desert so i guess it would be safe

273
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,880
to guess that

274
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,959
the sahara desert there in northern

275
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,120
africa might get 180 or

276
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,079
200 millimeters of rain more than

277
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,040
antarctica

278
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,320
there you go fascinating fun fact number

279
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,680
one

280
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,279
down but hey there are more to come

281
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,079
after a break

282
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
desert

283
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,320
tina thinks of her grandmother every

284
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,320
time she hears the song

285
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,800
tina mate

286
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,800
thinks of the job as the opportunity of

287
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,079
a lifetime

288
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,320
mat

289
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:17,040
henry tried to think of a way to solve

290
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,959
dylan never thinks of anyone but himself

291
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,720
surprising geography facts russia covers

292
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,560
11 time zones

293
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
this is because of how vast the world's

294
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,160
largest country is

295
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,639
also notable is that russia is the only

296
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,480
country that borders both finland

297
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,959
in northern europe and north korea in

298
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,320
east asia

299
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,720
russia also controls an island called

300
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,079
big diomede

301
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,160
it sits less than four kilometers from

302
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,519
its sister island

303
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,760
little diomede owned by the united

304
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,800
states

305
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,240
although these two islands are

306
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,720
geographically close they sit on either

307
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,800
side of the international date line

308
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,120
so they have a 21-hour time difference

309
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,880
okay geography fun fact

310
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,839
number two and this is going to be

311
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,320
surprising now we all know that russia

312
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,720
is

313
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,000
big real big it's a big country biggest

314
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,040
country in the world

315
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,519
it's by far the biggest country in the

316
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,519
world but get this

317
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,720
russia covers

318
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,839
11 time zones

319
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,519
wow 11. but that's like half the world

320
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,959
that's like half the world 24 time zones

321
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
24 hours a day in the united states

322
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,040
there's like three or four

323
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,839
time zones at most and that's not

324
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,480
including

325
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,720
alaska throw that out of there right

326
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,759
russia

327
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,880
11 time zones wow canada's the second

328
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,800
biggest country i think it's like

329
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,199
six and a half time zones or something

330
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,800
like that so russia

331
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,120
is really big and it's really big in an

332
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,000
east-west

333
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,639
way as we can see because it stretches

334
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,680
basically around

335
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,160
half the world half the world would be

336
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,399
12 time zones like from here to new york

337
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,120
city

338
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,639
that's 12 time zones so russia's almost

339
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,519
the same size stretching around the top

340
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,320
of the world

341
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,720
it's very big this is because of of

342
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,360
course

343
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,880
how vast the world's largest country

344
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,560
is yeah there are many words many

345
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,639
adjectives you can use to describe

346
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,360
russia

347
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,000
and vast is certainly a very good one

348
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,759
because vast just means

349
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,959
huge really really really big

350
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,440
especially in kind of a geography kind

351
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,079
of way

352
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,560
the way something just covers a huge

353
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,000
area of land

354
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,240
as you stand on a mountain top and look

355
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,279
out over a

356
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,000
jungle or a forest and you it goes until

357
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,880
you can't even

358
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,520
see anymore that is a vast forest so

359
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
every time i'm in tokyo if you go up to

360
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,280
the top of a tall building

361
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,439
especially at night you just see lights

362
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,760
until you can't see any further because

363
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,880
tokyo is a

364
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,799
vast city it's really huge it covers a

365
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,520
massive area of only one time zone

366
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
though only one time zone tokyo that's a

367
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,720
very good point well

368
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,359
yeah probably for example the library

369
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:27,919
has a

370
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,200
vast selection of books to choose from

371
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,640
anyways also notable is that russia

372
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,720
is the only country that borders both

373
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,320
finland in northern europe and

374
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,600
north korea in east asia

375
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,720
sure it's fast it's vast it's it that it

376
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,919
definitely is that

377
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,760
that's right and russia and time zones

378
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
that's right and russia not only covers

379
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,280
most of the continent of

380
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,480
asia it also has a few islands out there

381
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,960
in the pacific ocean or maybe the bering

382
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,600
sea

383
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,720
it says russia also controls an

384
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,160
island called big diomede it

385
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,960
that island big diomede sits less than

386
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,360
four

387
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,559
kilometers from its sister island little

388
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,600
diomede

389
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,720
owned by the united states so this is up

390
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,559
in that northern part of the pacific

391
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,120
near

392
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,640
alaska and you know siberia or

393
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,440
wherever that is in in russia that very

394
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,520
far eastern part of russia

395
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,360
and actually they control two islands

396
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,200
that are very close to each other which

397
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,799
isn't a surprise because

398
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,200
they almost touch up there in the north

399
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
but here's the really interesting part

400
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
here's the really interesting point

401
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,520
although these two islands are

402
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,039
geographically close four kilometers

403
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:47,840
they

404
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,760
sit on either side of the international

405
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,440
date line so they have a 21

406
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,919
hour time difference if it's wednesday

407
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,280
on little diomede it's

408
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,919
tuesday on big diomede or the other way

409
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:02,960
around because of the

410
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,760
international date line wow about that

411
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,799
that's cool

412
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,799

416
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,840

but yellowstone is huge

421
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,240
it covers almost 9 000 square kilometers

422
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,520
of land

423
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,159
before it became a national park few

424
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:14,640
people

425
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,120

426
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,840
officials went there to find out more

427
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,720

428
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,600
artist made paintings of the area

429
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,440
when the u.s government saw the

430
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,760

431
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,760

wonderland didn't receive many visitors

441
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,799
because it was very far out west

442
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:01,520
a year after it opened the northern

443
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,080
