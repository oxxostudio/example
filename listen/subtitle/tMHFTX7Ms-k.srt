landmark landmark big ben is one of

21
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,520
london's

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,400
most famous landmarks so we're still

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,200
talking about

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880
you know the high line and how it was

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,840
transformed into a beautiful park

26
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,320
yeah and it's a great way to go and

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,600
explore

28
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
new york city that's right because you

29
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,720
can kind of go up

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,960
and above and then walk around and see

31
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,840
lots of really

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,640

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,840
so you can see like the meat packing

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,200
district which is

36
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,680
quite famous what else can you see i

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,200
think there's also like art and

38

fashion and business centers and you can

39
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,799
also see the river too

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,280
right oh there's like chelsea market ah

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,200
the birthplace of oreo cookies

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,759
that's a really famous thing and then by

43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,439
the end you can get to

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,079
uh mercado like the little spain it's

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,759

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,920
to explore right and there's the beauty

50
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,840

line to now the beautiful park

54
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,440
yeah i really love when they do that

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,560
kind of like a kind of a renaissance

56
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,040
of an area when it starts to lose its

57
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,000
original

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,239
function or purpose and then they

59
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,160
repurpose it into something beautiful

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,239

new york city's highest park

68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,160
the high line has multiple entrances but

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,080
many people begin at the park's southern

70
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,720
end the trail here winds its way through

71
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,239
the meatpacking district

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,480
a historic meat processing area that's

73
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,360
now an art

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
fashion and business center and

75
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,840
eventually takes you to a lovely river

76
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
scene

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,120
today's lesson is called a walk on the

78
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,040
high line

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,080
new york city's highest

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,159
park part two hello everyone my name

81
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,560
is jeff and i'm mike and yes we're

82
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,280
learning about

83
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,840
new york city's highest and probably

84
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,680
most unusual park

85
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,799
this was originally an elevated railway

86
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,200
that carried trains and goods right

87
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,080
through the middle of

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,799
manhattan through the middle of new york

89
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:35,599
city but

90
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,560
since 2009 the city has been turning it

91
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
into a park

92
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,720
yes a park that is above the streets and

93
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,040
there

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,360
people could today can walk for a mile

95
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,239
and a half

96
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,120
see art exhibits eat delicious food at

97
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,159
food stands

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,080
and of course see a lot of beautiful

99
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,319
gardens and trees and stuff like that

100
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:54,799
yeah

101
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,840
in a park above the city streets so we

102
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,400
begin today's article by a question with

103
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,000
a question it says so

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,200
what's the best way to spend a day in

105
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,360
new york city's highest park if you're

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,920
like me

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,080
and you've never been to the high line

108
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
what would be some good advice for how

109
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,200
to enjoy it

110
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,439
if you're going there for the first time

111
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,720
well i've got an answer

112
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,798
all right i got an answer there for you

113
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,120
mike the high line

114
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,759
has multiple entrances there are many

115
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,759
different ways you can get in there

116
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,520
but many people begin at the parks

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,720
southern end not another not the

118
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,280
northern

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,320
and we want to go to the southern end

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
interesting all right so you can enter

121
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,400
it from many different places

122
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,080
of course these are probably the old

123
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,880
train stations along the old railway

124
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,639
that way that's why we see that

125
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,400
adjective multiple

126
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,280
entrances an entrance is a way in right

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,479
the opposite would be an

128
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,520
exit a way out multiple just means

129
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,240
many more than one we could say the high

130
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,280
line has

131
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
many entrances all right we're just

132
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,880
using this word multiple

133
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
but it basically means the same as many

134
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,000
or a lot

135
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,240
for a lot more than one for example

136
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,120
joanna

137
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,240
made multiple copies of the report she

138
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,400
didn't just write one and keep it safe

139
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,639
no she made lots of copies or many

140
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,880
copies so that she would have

141
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,160
more okay now the trail here from the

142
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,960
southern end

143
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
the southern the southern end yeah the

144
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,360
southern and that the northern

145
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,400
the southern end the trail here winds

146
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,600
its way

147
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,280
through the meat packing district

148
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,479
a historic meat processing area that's

149
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,120
now an

150
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,400
art fashion and business center and

151
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,880
eventually takes you to a lovely

152
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,440
river scene so when we're talking about

153
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
a district we're talking about

154
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,160
a neighborhood or a part of a city

155
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,440
that's got its own

156
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,240
defining characteristic hey what do they

157
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,080
do in that part of the city

158
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,639
meat packing it's the meat packing

159
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,160
district for example

160
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,520
toronto's entertainment district

161
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,039
has some of the city's best restaurants

162
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,160
also there's entertainment oh okay so we

163
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
might have a financial district with all

164
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,800
the

165
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,280
offices of banks and stuff like that an

166
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,400
entertainer a

167
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,560
shopping district with many malls and

168
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,479
stores things like that so

169
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,400
yeah it's a little bit of a different

170
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
part of a major

171
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,919
city and we also talked about this being

172
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,280
a historic

173
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,440
area or district of new york something

174
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,479
that's historic

175
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,960
this adjective just means it's important

176
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,840
to history

177
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,479
all right so it's old obviously but it's

178
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:39,360
not something that

179
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,080
just was a a common thing in the past or

180
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,479
we don't know who owned it or who lived

181
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,840
there or something no

182
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,680
we do know because there's someone

183
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,000
important or some important events

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,160
or something like that happen to it

185
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,000
historians will study it

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
if it's something historic we might find

187
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,039
it in a museum

188
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,680
or something like that it's important to

189
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
history for example

190
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,160
a statue marks the location where a

191
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,039
historic

192
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,160
event took place many years ago

193

someone was born there or some important

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,479
treaty was signed or

like that

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,759
something that was important to history

198
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,120

further on you'll find chelsea market

208
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,519
the birthplace of the oreo cookie

209
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,320
and an ideal spot to stop for lunch

210
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,120
after that

211
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,279
the tracks run past areas thick with

212
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,240
plants where you may see local birds

213
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
you'll also spot one of the most famous

214
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,760
landmarks in the city

215
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,480
the empire state building as well as art

216
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,560
pieces that vary throughout the year

217
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,360
okay so we've we've started at the

218
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,040
southern end there we've moved

219
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,440
along the meat packing district there

220
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,680
we've got a lovely view of the river

221
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,120
and you know what further on you'll find

222
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,320
chelsea market the birthplace

223
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,000
of the oreo cookie and

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,240
an ideal spot to stop for lunch though

225
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,160
you won't have to sit there and eat like

226
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,079
a bag full of oreos or

227
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,959
anything like that there are nice

228
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,640
restaurants where you can eat

229
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,040
things other than oreo cookies yes

230
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,680
a lunch of oreo cookies probably would

231
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,120
not be

232
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,880
ideal anyways if something is ideal

233
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,839
though

234
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,800
it's pretty good it's not perfect but

235
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,279
it's

236
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,360
close it's not perfect it's not perfect

237
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,760
it's not exactly right but it's really

238
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,399
close it's super awesome it's great for

239
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,440
example

240
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,880
we have found an ideal spot to have

241
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,240
a picnic this is a super great place to

242
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:42,959
have a picnic

243
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,720
is it the best place ever no but boy

244
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,680
is it close it's almost heaven all right

245
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
so as we're walking along the high line

246
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,760
from the south we might notice a slight

247
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,040
change maybe the

248
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,880
southern end has more of those art

249
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,240
exhibits or food

250
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,800
stands but then as we continue on it

251
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,240
says after that

252
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,279
the tracks run past areas thick with

253
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,959
plants where you may see local birds so

254
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,240
it sounds like it gets a

255
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,320
little bit more wild as we move away

256
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,200
from the chelsea market and meat packing

257
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,760
district areas a few few bigger plants

258
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,279
and trees maybe we

259
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,839
hear more birds and also if we look

260
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,120
through those trees

261
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,760
we will see a very famous new york city

262
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,399
site

263
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,600
it says you'll also spot one of the most

264
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,640
famous landmarks in the city the

265
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,440
empire state building as well as art

266
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,040
pieces that vary

267
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,279
throughout the year wow very cool so we

268
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,880
have nature around us

269
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,800
if we look between the buildings we'll

270
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,519
see that famous landmark the empire

271
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,880
state building you know the one that

272
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,600

274
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,200

site

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,680
something that you would look at maybe

281
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,200
in a postcard or

282
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,519
if you go to a a country or a city

283
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,360

284
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,680
it kind of marks that place if you see

of the park you'll likely have an

313
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,519
appetite again

314
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,199

381
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,280
old river

382
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,160

386
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,600
old river i don't know the name

387

years ago or 15 years ago

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,520
back to life now it's a tourist

393
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,480
attraction

394
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,640
people go there and sit by the water in

395
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,120
the summer it's clean and wonderful so

396
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120

397
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,520

398
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,440
of a city taking something that was

399
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,039

403
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,440

melissa said

411
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,880
melissa took a hot bath before going to

412
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,760
bed

413
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,919

[Music]

420
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,240
it's cold here in alaska thank goodness

421
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,760
i have my igloo to keep me warm igloos

422
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,080
are

423
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,799
made of snow so they don't look like

424
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,400
they can keep people warm

425
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,000
but they actually do a great job

426
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,480
a well-made igloo can increase the

427
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,919
inside temperature

428
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,000
40 degrees above the outside temperature

429
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
the walls of the igloo block out the

430
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,240
wind

431
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,880
freezing winds can make the air feel

432
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,320
much colder

433
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,200
the inuit invented igloos hundreds of

434
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,480
years ago

435
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,799
most people believe that inuit lived in

436
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:25,600
igloos

437
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,679
all the time actually igloos were used

438
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,280
mainly by hunters hunters stated igloos

439
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,320
while they hunted for seals to build an

440
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,039
igloo

441
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,720
you need the right kind of snow the soft

442
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,320
powdery kind isn't ideal it can't be

443
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,760
packed tightly enough

444
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,039
to build an igloo now it looks like the

445
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,159
snow conditions

446
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,520
are pretty good if you want i could show

447
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,640

451
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,600

452
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,840
special

453
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,320
dome shape

454
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,799

462
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,240
next to the door

463
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:52,559
block they used blocks of stone

464
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,240
to build a strong wall

465
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,400
temperature temperatures suddenly

466
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,200
dropped

467
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,840
last week
