28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,080
famous actor

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,720
right have you ever seen billy elliot

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,439
yes i

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,840
have and i didn't know that was tom

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,560
holland

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,040
i didn't know that either i didn't make

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,159
the connection

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,799
between billy elliot because he was

36
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,680
pretty young

37
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,960
that's right when he played billy

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,400
elliott i didn't know that there was a

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,680
connection between that and spider-man

40
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
i love the movie billy elliott me too

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,439
so good it was a good performance by tom

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:48,079
holland and

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,640
you can tell that he is a great dancer

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,200
right so he always did have a natural

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
talent right and dancing and he liked

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,560
dancing and performing

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,399
and his mother always knew that he was

48
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,640
going to do something big one day right

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,000
that's right so she did actually support

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,920
him in this dream and then he did

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,119
try out for uh start to learn ballet

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,680
so that he could do billy elliot i think

53
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,200
he trained for a little while and then

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,160
he landed this

55
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,200
role and that's pretty impressive and it

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,599
led

57
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,440
to a huge thing which is

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,560
becoming spy spiderman spiderman

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,760
and he signed a six picture deal so that

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,560
means

61
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,360
six spiderman movies that's a lot of

62
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,840
money

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
okay i think he has he would have enough

64
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,120
money for the rest of his life

65
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,920
that's so cool he's a really talented

66
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,319
actor

67
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,319
definitely his big break okay let's

68
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,519
learn more about

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,040
tom holland all right let's go

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,640
tom holland from ballet to spider-man

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,080
and beyond tom holland's mother always

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,920
knew he had star power

73
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,560
even when he was just a baby he just

74
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,239
wouldn't quit dancing

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,480

son up for hip-hop dance classes

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,599
at a local studio in london she never

78
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,000
imagined this would set him on a path to

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,560

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,720
he's still a very young guy

97
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,280
a young actor but he's had quite an

98
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
interesting career so far

99
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,519
and he's got some cool things coming up

100
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,840
for us to enjoy so let's find out more

101
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
about tom holland and how he went from

102
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,879
ballet

103
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,120
to spider-man and what he's going to

104
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,400
continue to do

105
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,519
he went from ballet yeah to spider-man

106
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,840
who knew

107
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,399
interesting anyways tom holland's mother

108
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,519
always knew he had a star

109
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,960
power or had star power i should say

110
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,400
even when he was just a baby

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,919
he just wouldn't quit dancing

112
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,919
so he was a young dancer but no he

113
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,479
wasn't actually ballet dancing from the

114
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,280
beginning

115
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
it was a different form of dance he

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,560
loved to dance but

117
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,600
not necessarily in classical ballet so

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,400
next we read so when he was old enough

119
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:44,800
she

120
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,440
that's his mother she signed her son up

121
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,680
for hip-hop dance classes

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,120
at a local studio in london ah okay

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,040
so like a lot of young kids it wasn't

124
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,520
ballet that was so interesting to him it

125
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
was hip-hop dancing

126
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,000
dancing to hip-hop music break dancing

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,080
things like that that's what he really

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,520
wanted to learn and sure

129
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,600
if you're going to learn a type of art

130
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,560
or perform or even practice or do

131
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,440
a type of art a studio is the kind of

132
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
place you might do it

133
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,440
we often think of a studio as a space

134
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,960
where artists work

135
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,000
in some kind of way a painter's studio

136
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,800
might be a big

137
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,039
open place with lots of windows to let

138
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:25,840
in light

139
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,000
a dance studio would have very little

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,360
furniture just a big

141
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,160
open floor some mirrors on the wall and

142
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,600
that's where dancers

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,840
would practice and perform mostly

144
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,720
practicing

145
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
mostly working on their art and then

146
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,560
they might take the art out of the

147
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,360
studio

148
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,840
put it in a gallery if it's a painter a

149
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,400
painter

150
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,639
or perform it on a stage if it's a

151
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,479
dancer but whether where they do the

152
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,320
work where they do their practice

153
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,639
that would be in a studio for example

154
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,600
larissa

155
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,720
signed up for dance classes at a studio

156
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,440
close to her house all right so it was

157
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,880
hip-hop dance now

158
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
his mother was probably thinking this

159
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,960
would be you know good exercise good to

160
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,440
get his energy out he likes to dance you

161
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:07,759
know

162
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,680
maybe he'll get to perform with a pop

163
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,479
star or be in a music video but

164
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,280
to go from hip hop to superhero movies

165
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,960
that probably wasn't what she expected

166
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,039
that probably did not occur to her

167
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,680
no at that point she thought all right

168
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,759
we'll start him off there at the hip-hop

169
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,199
dancing all right and then

170
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,240
maybe we'll advance to ballet because

171
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,280
no one ballet dances out of the womb but

172
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,240
yeah she never

173
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,440
imagined this this start

174
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,560
in hip-hop dancing class would

175
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,919
set him on a path to hollywood anyways

176
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,680
folks with that let's go ahead and

177
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,560
take a break but when we come back we'll

178
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
hear more about

179
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,440
tom holland hello

180
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,649
[Music]

181
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,840
tom holland from ballet to spider-man

182
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,360
and beyond when holland was 10 years old

183
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,000
a talent scout suggested he try out for

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,919
billy elliot the musical

185
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,319
a play about a young boy who follows his

186
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,120
dream of becoming a ballet dancer

187
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,599
holland didn't know ballet but with his

188
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,039
dance teacher's guidance

189
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,440
he trained for two years and landed a

190
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,320
part

191
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,479
he did so well that he was given the

192
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,440
title role

193
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,320
after only two months of performing this

194
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,680
was holland's big break

195
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,320
okay when holland was 10 years old

196
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,000
a talent scout suggested he try out

197
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,519
for billy elliot the musical

198
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,720
a play about a young boy

199
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,000
who follows his dream of becoming

200
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,519
a ballet dancer so there you go

201
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,680
he was in hip-hop class there and he

202
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,839
wasn't necessarily going to move on to

203
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,080
ballet but hey

204
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,880
a talent scout saw him and said you've

205
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,080
got to try out

206
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,040
for this musical you're perfect for it

207
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,000
you're gonna

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,120
knock it out of the park it'll be a home

209
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,760
run

210
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,320
for you anyways this talent scout

211
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,440
suggested he try this out if you suggest

212
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,720
something to someone you recommend this

213
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,200
thing

214
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,480
to them you say you should probably

215
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,839
do this for example my friend

216
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,959
terry suggested a great restaurant for

217
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,000
us to try

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
okay moving on so billy

219
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,240
elliott the musical that's right not the

220
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:54,720
movie

221
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,040
no the musical that's right very popular

222
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,560
musical in london

223
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,320
and one of those musicals where there's

224
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,399
a kid in the main role as

225
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,720
billy elliot and as the kids grow up

226
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,079
right they need to find

227
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,640
new people to continue on the role so

228
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,200
this is a good chance for a young actor

229
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,079
with some dancing skills to get a pretty

230
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,160
big job a pretty big role

231
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,959
but of course tom holland was a hip-hop

232
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,760
dancer

233
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,240
billy elliot is not a hip-hop musical

234
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,959
it's about a young guy who does ballet

235
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,079
so holland didn't know ballet

236
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,440
but with his dance teacher's guidance

237
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,959
he trained for two years

238
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,000
and landed apart he basically had to

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,560
learn how to ballet dance from scratch

240
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:40,959
from

241
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,600
zero it took him two years he had some

242
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,880
dancing ability

243
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,760
but hip-hop and ballet not a lot of

244
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,040
similarity there so he needed guidance

245
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,120
from a teacher and that's what teachers

246
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,040
give people they give people

247
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,440
guidance they give them advice they give

248
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,399
them wisdom

249
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,480
they give them training and knowledge

250
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,720
they show them skills they answer their

251
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,680
questions

252
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,720
they basically set you on they suggest

253
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,959
they suggest stuff they set you on a

254
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,480
path to success

255
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,640
and if you follow their guidance if you

256
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,240
follow their instruction

257
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,320
listen to what they want to teach you

258
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,640
then you will be successful for example

259
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,920
i got into my dream school thanks to my

260
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,800
parents

261
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
guidance i asked them hey i want to go

262
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
to this great school

263
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,640
what should i do and they suggested all

264
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,399
these things so i listened to their

265
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:30,959
advice

266
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,920
i took their guidance so two years of

267
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:34,880
hard work

268
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,120
now he was a ballet dancer two years of

269
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,399
his life that's right

270
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,200
now he was a ballet dancer but at all

271
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,959
two years his life but he did

272
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,399
land this role yeah he did so well

273
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,519
that he was given the title role

274
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,200
after only two months of performing so

275
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,240
he was an

276
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,720
understudy perhaps for a couple of

277
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,519
months

278
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,360
and then they said hey this person is

279
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,560

280
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880

281
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,680

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
time for us to take a break but don't go

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,079
we'll be right back after this

295
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839

under-study k-1

298
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,519
tom holland from ballet to spider-man

299
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,040
and beyond by the time holland was 16

300
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,519
he was getting major parts in films as

301
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,760
well as excellent reviews

302
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,920
despite his achievements he didn't feel

303
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,120
successful

304
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,440
his mom even sent him to carpentry

305
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,279
school as a backup plan

306
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,480
in case acting didn't work out however

307
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,440
at the age of 19 he got the offer of a

308
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,639
lifetime

309
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,440
a six-picture deal to play spider-man in

310
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,160
the marvel

311
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,279
cinematic universe

312
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,360
okay holland he has hit

313
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,440
the big time he landed the lead role

314
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,480
there in

315
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,160
billy elliott the musical well done

316
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,680
and by the time holland was 16

317
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,040
he was getting major parts and films

318
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,480
as well as excellent reviews now that's

319
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,199
important

320
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,399
okay he was getting those good parts but

321
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,360
the critics

322
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,480
also liked him not only

323
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,800
was he getting these parts but he was

324
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,360
doing a good job and people were

325
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,079
noticing

326
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,720
that he had talent yeah and people were

327
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,120
definitely paying attention all right so

328
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,880
let's see what it says next

329
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,480
yes despite his achievements he didn't

330
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
feel

331
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,440
successful he thought i'm not that great

332
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,279
i've done a couple of good things i

333
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,040
guess but

334
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,720
am i really all that successful nah

335
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,120
anyways here we have the noun

336
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,880
achievement to talk about

337
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,440
and achievement is something noteworthy

338
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:41,920
cool

339
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,839
great awesome that you do successfully

340
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,880
if you reach a goal that you've really

341
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,839
been working

342
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,279
hard to achieve and you get there

343
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,320
that's an achievement graduating from

344
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:56,959
college

345
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,519
is an achievement climbing a mountain is

346
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,320
an achievement

347
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,880
completing a project at school can be an

348
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000
achievement

349
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,040
putting your socks on in the morning

350
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,800
not an achievement that wasn't that

351
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,720
wasn't hard to do the same thing goes

352
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,440
for

353
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,160
drinking a cup of coffee in the morning

354
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,279
so on so

355
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,560
forth for example finding a cure for the

356
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,360
disease is perhaps the scientists

357
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,839
greatest achievement there you go

358
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,160
finding a cure for a disease

359
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,519
now that's an achievement okay so

360
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,759
tom holland didn't think he was all that

361
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,040
successful

362
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,440
and i guess his mom shared these

363
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,480
feelings

364
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,839
because his mom even sent him

365
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,639
to carpentry school as a backup plan

366
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,000
in case acting didn't work out

367
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,800
wow very interesting so his mom thought

368
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,360
well

369
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,440
you might have skills as a dancer and

370
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,199
success as an actor but

371
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,040
you need to have something in case this

372
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,120
whole show business thing just

373
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,000
doesn't happen carpentry carpentry

374
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
making things with your hands out of

375
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,679
wood tables and chairs and carving

376
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,679
cabinets and stuff like that well

377
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,599
you know we might laugh but you can make

378
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,839
a lot of money as a skilled carpenter

379
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,880
jesus was a carpenter that too

380
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,799
