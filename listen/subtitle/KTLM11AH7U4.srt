pretty and she's also very fit that's

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,789

Wonder Woman yeah she actually won Miss

30
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,869

32
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:51,429
that's right right it says then she had

33
00:01:51,429 --> 00:01:54,729

64
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,530
recent Kerrison actor to play the

65
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,990
character of Wonder Woman in a very

66
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,180
popular movie that came out a couple of

67
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,540
years ago and I think I hear a sequel

68
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,090
coming because it was a super super

69
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,130
popular movie critics loved it

00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,680
audiences loved it it made tons of money

71
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,230
I think it actually was the most popular

72
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:50,970
of those DC comics I believe right with

73
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,710
Superman Aquaman I think Wonder Woman

74
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,260
was by far their biggest movie and it

75
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,510
was it was a good film anyways it was a

76
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:01,210
big success one way or another and

77
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,610
because it's a superhero movie you have

78
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,700
to make a sequel more I actually believe

79
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,740
this is going to be the third movie with

80
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,100
gal gadot playing Wonder Woman but yes

81
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,050
this is going to be Wonder Woman too

82
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,030
anyways

83
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,700
Wonder Woman is a wonder of a woman

84
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,519
Wonder Woman is one of the strongest

85
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,080
female characters in the superhero

86
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,730
universe yeah Black Widow is pretty good

87
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,270
but she's not as good as Wonder Woman so

88
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,700

89
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,730

thanks to her looks winning the Miss

173
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,480
Israel competition when she was eight

174
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,320
teen now this victory eventually led to

175
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,650
a modeling career but first she would

176
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,700
have to complete her required two-year

177
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,340
military service so here nowadays in

178
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,530
Taiwan I believe you have to go to the

179
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:40,320
military for a certain period of time

180
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,450
it's not as long of time as it once was

181
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,060
but in Israel they take the defence very

182
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,280
seriously people have to go into the

183
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,020
military boy or girl

184
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,630
for two years that's right and it's a

185
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,330
pretty tough service what the real army

186
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,300
in the in the Israeli Defense Forces so

187
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,430
we read she took on the challenge with

188
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,580
grace working as an instructor in the

189
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,670
Israeli Defence Force the IDF that's

190
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,499
what we call the Israeli army

191
00:09:08,499 --> 00:09:10,449
Air Force Navy all of that stuff yeah

192
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,639
and everyone all young people have to

193
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,219
serve two years in the IDF but she took

194
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:17,469
on the challenge with grace

195
00:09:17,469 --> 00:09:19,929
oh it says she took on the challenge and

196
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:22,419
she made it look good

197
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,339
okay when you do something with grace

198
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:27,519
you do it with style okay let's say you

199
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,599
dance with grace

200
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:30,249
people might think there that your

201
00:09:30,249 --> 00:09:33,039
movements are beautiful yes basically if

202
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,779
you do something with grace you do that

203
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:37,479
thing and you look good while you're

204
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,489
doing that thing for example the

205
00:09:39,489 --> 00:09:41,619
president showed considerable grace

206
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:44,949
during the crisis did he cry that he

207
00:09:44,949 --> 00:09:49,209
loses temper no way and yes gal gadot is

208
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:51,039
very similar this she took on this

209
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,169
challenge with grace it was tough but

210
00:09:53,169 --> 00:09:55,359
she did it and she did it well okay so

211
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,219
you handle things well with some

212
00:09:57,219 --> 00:09:59,589
sensitivity with some thought with some

213
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:03,219
wisdom in a stressful situation you do

214
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:05,589
very very well when many other people

215
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:08,229
might just really panic or not handle it

216
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:10,629
so good for her joining the army being

217
00:10:10,629 --> 00:10:12,669
an instructor would be a challenging

218
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:15,369
stressful job she did it well what is an

219
00:10:15,369 --> 00:10:17,349
instructor basically it's a teacher

220
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:19,479
it's a coach it's someone who teaches

221
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:22,149
you how to do things yeah you could call

222
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,939
your math teacher your math instructor

223
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:26,739
but we often use it for a more

224
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:29,769
specialized kind of skill something more

225
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:31,779
like a coach more like learning how to

226
00:10:31,779 --> 00:10:33,759
play a musical instrument a piano

227
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,769
instructor you could have someone

228
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,470
teaching you how to dance or act or sing

229
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,659
or something like that so they're

230
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:42,399
teaching you a skill but often it's a

231
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,470
more specialized skill than what

232
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,689
teachers in normal schools do for

233
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:49,689
example my dancing instructor studied

234
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:52,539
for many years in France calling it your

235
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:55,329
dance teacher your dance coach yeah

236
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:57,699
instructors probably just as good a word

237
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,139
anyways more on service they're in the

238
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:04,439
IDF let's hear from gal gadot right now

239
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:09,159
you give two or three years and it's not

240
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,479
about you she said in a 2016 interview

241
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:15,789
yes you give over two or three years of

242
00:11:15,789 --> 00:11:18,699
your life to a cause it's not about you

243
00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:21,790
at all and she also says you learn this

244
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,360
Appling and respect by the way here we

245
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,130
have the word discipline it's a noun

246
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,150
okay if you have discipline you have

247
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,460
self-control okay you've practice a lot

248
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,990
and now you have control over yourself

249
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:38,200
your movements your schedule and stuff

250
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,410
like that when I was growing up I got

251
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,390
very lucky as far as discipline was

252
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,880
concerned my parents always made me get

253
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,490
up and do my make my bed every single

254
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,160
day I woke up early and I made my bed

255
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,130
every day and to this day I still do

256
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,440
that I have carried that discipline with

257
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,080
me all the way to where I am now

258
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,210
anyways our example sentence for the

259
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,060
noun discipline is Toni quit taking

260
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,850
guitar lessons because he didn't have

261
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,640
the discipline to stick with them he

262
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,740
wouldn't practice every day he wouldn't

263
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:14,050
do the exercises he just didn't have

264
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:16,450
that self-control yeah that's true when

265
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,090
you're teaching yourself to do something

266
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,740
you need a lot more discipline than if

267
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,690
you have someone telling you to do it or

268
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,730
if you're doing it with others self

269
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,800
discipline is important well alright

270
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,480

271
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,330

acting career in an Israeli TV show

star in several entries of the popular

310
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:23,409
franchise but it was her performance as

311
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:25,839
Wonder Woman in Batman V Superman dawn

312
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,749
of Justice and the heroines eponymous

313
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:31,509
film in 2017 that gadot is best known

314
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,939
for this would turn out to be the role

315
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:38,069
of a lifetime for the Israeli actress

316
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,540
okay moving on let's learn some more

317
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,390
about gal gadot after beginning her

318
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,740
acting career in an Israeli TV show

319
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,440
gadot made her feature film debut in

320
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,240
2009 fast and furious I'm sure everybody

321
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,060
knows of these movies they've made nine

322
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,510
of them now I think oh my goodness what

323
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,560
a film franchise that is anyways she got

324
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,480
out of the military maybe did some

325
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,940
modeling and then she started her acting

326
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,400
career yeah and she started off strong

327
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,279
first in a TV show there in Israel and

328
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,560
then she made her debut she got her big

329
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,110
start in Fast and Furious there in 2009

330
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,770
Wow two things that was eleven years ago

331
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,230
that movie came out that's amazing and

332
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,720
it's also seems that she was popular in

333
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,150
the films because we read she would

334
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,910
later star in several entries of the

335
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,130
popular franchise so maybe part two

336
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,709
three four a few of the other Fast &

337
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,570
Furious movies if you watch them again

338
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,910
she'll be in there I don't remember her

339
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,500
it might be worth watching one of those

340
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,470
older ones again but anyways it was her

341
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:57,190
performance as Wonder Woman in Batman vs

342
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,310
Superman dawn of Justice and the

343
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,060
heroines eponymous film in 2017 that

344
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,500
gadot is best known for yes here she

345
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,860
wasn't Batman vs Superman that makes

346
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,740
four films that she has been a part of

347
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,650
as Wonder Woman I believe it's Batman vs

348
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:21,730
Superman Wonder Woman Justice League and

349
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,930
now Wonder Woman part two how about that

350
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,450
anyways yes she became Wonder Woman and

351
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,330
this would turn out to be the role of a

352
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,270
lifetime for the Israeli actress there

353
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,430
you know the role of a lifetime to land

354
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,529
this role it means that you're pretty

355
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:40,770
much set for life as an actress

356
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,670
absolutely it's kind of what we would

357
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,070
say the role that turned her into a

358
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,290
household name she was in some other

359
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,780
movies before but this is the one that

360
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,259
