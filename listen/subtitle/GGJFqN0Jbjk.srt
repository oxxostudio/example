00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:28,320
[Music]

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
hi everyone this is karen welcome

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,359
everybody i'm shane

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,280
today we're looking at part one of

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,800
putting pen to

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,239
paper the history of ballpoint pens

9
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,360
and the vocabulary words are invention

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,079
invention the telephone is one of the

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:44,480
most

12
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,399
important inventions of all time i agree

13
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
leak leak air is leaking out of the tire

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,440
and i don't know what to do about it

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,800
familiar familiar food delivery drivers

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,320
are a familiar site

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,359
on the streets of most big cities

18
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,799
inconvenience inconvenience my computer

19
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,840
crashed this morning which is a major

20
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,360
inconvenience for me transfer

21
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,479
transfer i transferred the money into

22
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,840
your bank account thank you

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,439
inspiration inspiration the artist says

24
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,320
he gets his inspiration from his daily

25
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,920
life

26
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,680
so we're talking about ballpoint pen

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,560
ballpoint pens yes because they have a

28
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:34,960
ball

29
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,799
right that's right kind of like the key

30
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,280
so the guys what a great invention

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,759
the guy who invented it is laszlo bureau

32
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,119
spiro that's right

33
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,759
yeah so before before that they would

34
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,159
use

35
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,479
fountain pens but i like fountain pens

36
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,520
dough well

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
they're very cool yes they're very cool

38
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,119
and they're kind of retro

39
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,439
uh-huh right but have you ever used one

40
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,960
i have used it but

41
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,520
they're not that easy to use and i have

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
to say the inconvenience is that you

43
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,479
have to

44
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,880
refill the ink all the time and

45
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,840
sometimes

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,600
it would you know probably smudge

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,199
writing so it's

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,280
not exactly that convenient but it just

49
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,640
feels really cool because

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,879
no one really uses it anymore right but

51
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,160
the reason they started

52
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,280
used wanted to change this type of

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,959
writing instrument to another one was

54
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,720
because of the inconveniences

55
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,640
that's right so the way the ballpoint

56
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,000
pen works

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,920
is that the ink is kind of like inside a

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
little tube and when the ball is pushed

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,800
down it gets

60
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,840
the little ball wet with the ink

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
that's right and it's a constant supply

62
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,120
i think

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
it doesn't really smudge yeah but it's

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,360
pretty cool where he got his idea from

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,959
because one time i remember

66
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,680
he saw some kids playing with the marble

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,280
and it went through the puddle and he

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,720
saw like a line

69
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,640
you know of like you know muddy water

70
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,280
he's like hey maybe i can turn that

71
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,080
into a ballpoint pen that's super

72
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,640
interesting

73
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,080
okay let's learn more about the

74
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,239
ballpoint pen all right enjoy

75
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,879
putting pen to paper the history of

76
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,560
ballpoint pens

77
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,480
ballpoint pens may not seem like

78
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,239
anything special but they've made our

79
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,920
lives more convenient than you might

80
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,959
realize

81
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,720
the story behind their invention may

82
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
also surprise you

83
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
today's lesson is called putting pen

84
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,280
to paper the history of ball

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,440
point pens part one hello everyone my

86
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,480
name is jeff

87
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,440
and i'm mike now if you look around you

88
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,360
right now look at the desk and maybe

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,760
you're sitting at school or at home

90
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,400
you'll probably see a nice little pen

91
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,000
lying around on a table

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,560
in a drawer maybe in your pocket and

93
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,480
there's a good chance

94
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,599
that will be a ball point pen they're

95
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,640
cheap they're convenient you always got

96
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,439
one around

97
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,280
if you're like me there's a drawer at

98
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,159
home full of old ballpoint pens

99
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,480
so we use these things all the time but

100
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,280
we never

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,519
really think about them but you're old

102
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,120
enough do you remember when you had to

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
like go to school and write on a slate

104
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,799
with a piece of chalk

105
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,399
no do you remember not having more point

106
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,160
no i don't remember not having a

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,519
ballpoint pen

108
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,519
anyways ballpoint pens are definitely an

109
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,040
improvement on them they are

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,240
yeah ballpoint pens yes

111
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,440
may not seem like anything special

112
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,479
but they've made our lives

113
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,840
more convenient than you might

114
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,520
realize yes ballpoint pens

115
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,960
are really super cool

116
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,600
and you know what they've got a super

117
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,080
cool

118
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,360
story too wonderful yeah the story

119
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
behind their invention may also

120
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,120
surprise you so you know how they came

121
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,600
to be

122
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
where they came from who created them or

123
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,520
invented them

124
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,919
all of this will probably be unknown to

125
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,440
you and will also

126
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,160
when we tell you surprise you by the way

127
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,960
invent

128
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,639
that's the verb when you invent

129
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,400
something you create

130
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,440
something that never existed before

131
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,520
okay now what you create what you invent

132
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,560
that's your invention for example

133
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,600
the telephone is one of the most

134
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,039
important inventions of

135
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,960
all time which is true

136
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
all right folks with that it's time for

137
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
us to take a short break but don't go

138
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,440
away

139
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,039
we will be back after

140
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,680
foreign

141
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,319
putting pen to paper the history of

142
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,000
ballpoint pens

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,720
laszlo bureau a hungarian journalist is

144
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
said to have invented the ballpoint pen

145
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,000
in 1938 before the ballpoint pen

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,319
people used fountain pens these

147
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,560
old-fashioned pens had to be refilled

148
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,280
often

149
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,240
and they leaked and smudged easily since

150
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,560
biro spent much of his day writing

151
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,840
he was all too familiar with these

152
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,970
inconveniences

153
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:06,000
[Music]

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,680
okay the history of the ballpoint pen

155
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,400
takes us to hungary

156
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,000
h u n g a

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,400
roi it it's a country i'm not actually

158
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,240
hungry anyways laszlo biro

159
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,000
a hungarian journalist a journalist

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,039
from hungary the country of hungary is

161
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,280
said to have invented the ballpoint pen

162
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,880
in 1938.

163
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
all right so not that long ago so what

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,120
were people using before the ballpoint

165
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,599
pen

166
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,479
came along like a feather well they they

167
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,319
did use that but

168
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
after that they had another more modern

169
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,520
pen before the ballpoint pen

170
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,879
people used fountain pens ah these are

171
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:01,919
the ones with that

172
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,479
metal tip and liquid ink that you have

173
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,599
to fill

174
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,400
quite frequently they spill places you

175
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:08,800
know

176
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,199
they can be a little bit inconvenient

177
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,080
but they were better

178
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,240
than the feather they were better than

179
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,879
hammering words into stone but fountain

180
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,039
pens yeah most people had those

181
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,199
they cost a bit more you had to be more

182
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,319
careful with them

183
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,199
and as we read these old fashioned pens

184
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,720
had to be refilled

185
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,000
often and they leaked and smudged

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,880
easily so yes these old fountain pens

187
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,599
they would

188
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,399
sometimes leak they wouldn't explode

189
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,039
shooting

190
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,599
ink all over the place no but it would

191
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,679
come out of them slowly maybe in your

192
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,799
pocket or

193
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,120
on the paper you're writing on because a

194
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,399
leak is a very

195
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,800
small amount or a small thing that's

196
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
escaping all right we're not talking

197
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,200
about

198
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,440
a huge amount we're talking a small

199
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,760
amount through probably a small

200
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,839
hole for example if you're riding your

201
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,800
bicycle

202
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,440
and you have a small leak that means the

203
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,080
air is

204
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,040
coming out of your tire very slowly as

205
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,279
it says in our example sentence

206
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,560
air is leaking out of the tire and i

207
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,279
don't know what to do well you can patch

208
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:13,600
it

209
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,480
cover up that little hole and stop that

210
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,040
leak

211
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,839
or if it's leaking slowly maybe ride to

212
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,720
a bike repair shop and buy a new tire

213
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
but you might be able to ride

214
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
for a little while longer because it's a

215
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
leak it's just coming out

216
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,959
slowly since biro spent much of his day

217
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,640
writing he was all too familiar

218
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,959
with these inconveniences those

219
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:43,600
old-fashioned pens were pains

220
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,360
and he knew all about these pains by the

221
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,720
way

222
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,839
if you are familiar with something

223
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,279
you know all about that thing

224
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,279
okay if you're if you're familiar with

225
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,440
someone you know that person

226
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,320
pretty well if you're unfamiliar with

227
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,279
them

228
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,320
not so well for example food delivery

229
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,360
drivers

230
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,880
are a familiar sight on the streets of

231
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,760
most

232
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,079
big cities okay and also

233
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,959
what's an inconvenience an inconvenience

234
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,000
is a small

235
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,800
but kind of annoying problem it's not a

236
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
major problem that's going to

237
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,760
totally change your life in a bad way

238
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,279
but it's one of those things that makes

239
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,079
you go

240
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:33,120
ah like that and then you'll move on and

241
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,040
you'll find a way to fix it if you need

242
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,519
to get

243
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,920
money out of the bank and you go to your

244
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,160
local atm machine and it's

245
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,000
it doesn't work for some reason well

246
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,079
that's an inconvenience you'll just have

247
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,320
to walk down to the next bank

248
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
and find one but if the whole banking

249
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,800
computer system breaks down

250
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,079
and you can't get any money out for 24

251
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,720
hours

252
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,600
that could be more than an inconvenience

253
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,959
that could be a problem

254
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,360
especially if you really need money at

255
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
that time but a small

256
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,720
problem that just makes your life a

257
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,240
little more difficult

258
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,320
but it's a problem you can easily work

259
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,240
your way around eventually

260
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
that would be an inconvenience my

261
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,839
computer crashed this

262
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,880
morning which is a major inconvenience

263
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,720
for me yeah it'll work tonight

264
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,200
but my boss or my teacher is waiting for

265
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,800
an important report

266
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,200
now i'll have to call them and explain

267
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,920
why

268
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,399
and say sorry but eventually the

269
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,120
computer will work

270
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,600
thank you very much for that there you

271
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,680
go anyways folks with that it's time for

272
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
us to take a short break but don't go

273
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,360
away we'll be right back well that's an

274
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,079
inconvenience

275
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,560
the house is said to have several secret

276
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,519
passageways

277
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,839
quill

278
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,360
putting pen to paper the history of

279
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,959
ballpoint pens

280
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,959
many inventors had tried to design

281
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,440
similar types of pens before b-roll

282
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,399
but none had succeeded biro's ballpoint

283
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,639
pen design used a small ball instead of

284
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,600
a nib

285
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,920
when the ball is pressed onto paper it

286
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,880
rolls to pick up

287
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,360
ink inside the pen and transfer it onto

288
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,480
paper

289
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,399
the inspiration for this design came

290
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,639
from an unexpected source

291
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,800
one day biro happened to see children

292
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,399
playing with marbles

293
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,639
a boy rolled a marble through a puddle

294
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,639
creating a line of water on the street

295
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,480
and giving biro the idea for the

296
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,160
ballpoint design

297
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,160
however the real breakthrough came when

298
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,000
biro got help from his brother

299
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,720
who was a scientist he developed a thick

300
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,519
fast drying

301
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,720
ink for biro's pen

302
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,040
wow what an inventor this uh bureau

303
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,240
guy was and i'm being serious

304
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,680
get this many inventors had

305
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,240
tried to design similar types of pens

306
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,240
before bureau but none

307
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,720
not a one had succeeded

308
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,639
bureau's ballpoint pen design

309
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,759
used a small ball

310
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,959
instead of a

311
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,240
nib oh okay well yeah fountain pens used

312
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,920
a nib that would basically

313
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,560
channel ink right down to the end and

314
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,079
that's what you would write with

315
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,199
but biro used a ball that kind of

316
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,240
spread the ink as you moved it over the

317
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
page or as we read when the ball

318
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,240
is pressed onto paper it rolls to pick

319
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,639
up

320
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,160
ink inside the pen and transfer it

321
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,639
onto the paper think about if there's

322
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,199
you know

323
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,839
paint or water on the ground and a car

324
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,120
rolls through it

325
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,680
it carries that water or paint in a

326
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,399
straight line it transfers

327
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,680
that water or paint down the road in a

328
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,560
line

329
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,920
there you go it goes from one place

330
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,160
to another it's being transferred

331
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,680
now very often well at least when i was

332
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,560
growing up

333
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,040
you would call some place like an office

334
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,120
or something like that

335
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,160
and you would be transferred

336
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,880
between departments let's say on the

337
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,480
telephone so

338
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,439
no one would be hanging up on you okay

339
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,799
the phone call wouldn't

340
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,599
end they would just be transferring you

341
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,000
from

342
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,679
one person to another until you got to

343
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:16,839
the

344
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,439
right person okay so you're trying to

345
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,240
make contact with the right person

346
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,640
you're trying to get transferred to the

347
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,880
right person but here the idea is a

348
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,679
little bit

349
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,880
simpler there is ink inside of the pen

350
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,600
and you want that ink onto the paper so

351
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,720
you go ahead

352
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,360
and you press down using that ballpoint

353
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,000
pen

354
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,039
and you're able to transfer that ink

355
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,480
onto the paper how simple is that

356
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,480
for example i transferred the money

357
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,840
into your bank account by the way yes in

358
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,880
these situations you would say transfer

359
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,160
and not transport okay

360
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,600
transfer is the word of choice here

361
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,880
anyways the inspiration for this

362
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,200
design came from an

363
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,679
unexpected source so there you go

364
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,679
everybody else was stuck with this nib

365
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,360
idea but hey this bureau guy he got

366
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,960
some inspiration from an unexpected

367
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,919
place

368
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,240
where you might not think that he would

369
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,760
get an idea

370
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,400
for a new type of pen and that's what an

371
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,280
ins that's what

372
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,160
inspiration is it's an idea for

373
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,880
something

374
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,080
new inventors need inspiration they

375
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,240
see something in the world that needs to

376
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,320
be fixed and there's not a machine

377
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,880
for it and then they think and think and

378
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,360
suddenly like a flash of light it comes

379
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,000
to them

380
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,480
i know what i'm going to do so an

381
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,760
inventor might need

382
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,880
inspiration for some new machine or new

383
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,080
technology

384
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,039
artists also will get inspiration for a

385
00:18:59,039 --> 00:18:59,679
new

386
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,480
painting or a new song or a new story

387
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,360
idea

388
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,440
no one's done it before they're just

389
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,880
walking around or

390
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,120
sitting around or washing the dishes

391
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,000
when suddenly

392
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,559
a new a new melody a new bit of music

393
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,280
pops into their head or a new idea for a

394
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
painting or a sculpture

395
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,000
whatever something new and creative is

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,480
born

397
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,039
in an instant that is inspiration or

398
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,400
what you see

399
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,280
gives you that inspiration that magic

400
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,640
creative spark

401
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,679
for example the artist says he gets his

402
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,360
inspiration from his daily life

403
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,679
inspiration that could happen but hey

404
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,840
with bureau it it did happen

405
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,000
okay what was the inspiration for his

406
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,960
pen it

407
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,000
it came from everyday life one day

408
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,160
biro happened to see children playing

409
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,640
with marbles oh those little little

410
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,679
glass balls

411
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,400
that the kids nothing special played

412
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:56,799
with

413
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,919
now a boy rolled a marble

414
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,000
through a puddle creating a line of

415
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,039
water on the street and

416
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,640
giving biro the idea for the ballpoint

417
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,280
design

418
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,679
oh so the ball went through this puddle

419
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,679
this small amount of water

420
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,080
rolled down probably a dry street and

421
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:18,880
made a nice

422
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,000
dark line of water there you go i'll

423
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,320
just do the same thing with a pen

424
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,960
and some ink however the real

425
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,240
breakthrough this that was the

426
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,200
inspiration

427
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,520
but the real breakthrough came when

428
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,760
bureau got help from his brother

429
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,039
who was a scientist because of course

430
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,360
you need the right kind of ink and his

431
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,159
brother

432
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,360
says he developed a thick fast

433
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,640
drying ink for beerus pen yeah it had to

434
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:46,960
be

435
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,200
thick because the other type of ink from

436
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,280
the fountain pen would just leak out

437
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,840
but also you want it to be fast drying

438
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,120
because one of the problems with

439
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,640
fountain pens is that

440
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,200
you often would spread that ink with

441
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
your hand and that's what make

442
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,080
would make it so messy so thick it stays

443
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,039
in the pen

444
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,600
fast drying when it hits the paper it

445
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,960
dries quickly

446
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,320
no mess there you go brilliant amazing

447
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,039
okay folks that's it for today's lesson

448
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:17,280
and it's time for us to say bye bye

449
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,200
take care of your ballpoint pens

451
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,400

455
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,720
hunters in the australian outback use a

456
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,840
tool called a

457
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,400
boomerang to go on a hunt with

458
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
aboriginal bushmen

459
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,120
when you throw it the right way it flies

460
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,559
back to you

461
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,960
that way you don't have to go find it

462
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,200
over and over again

463
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,720
the bent shape makes it fly in a curved

464
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,240
direction boomerangs have also been used

465
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,440
as weapons for

466
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,880
tens of thousands of years most people

467
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,240
think of australia

468
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
when they see a boomerang and they are

469
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,039
popular souvenirs for tourists who visit

470
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,400
the land down under but actually

471
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,880
the oldest boomerang was found in a cave

472
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,000
in poland

473
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,039
it was dated back to about 20 000

474
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,320
years ago there are a few designs of

475
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,679
boomerangs that fly

476
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,799
in different ways some don't fly back in

477
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,600
a curve

478
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,159
but they can be thrown faster and fly

479
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,480
further distances

480
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,039
you have to hold it vertically and throw

481
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,279
it at a 10 to 20 degree

482
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,400
angle when you release it
