14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,860
from digestion problems hmm

15
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,649
relieved relieved Omar took some

16
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:07,430
medicine to relieve his Medic so we're

17
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,580
talking about Miguel my god have you

18
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,240
ever been to lie um yeah of course yeah

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,340
I've been to lie before and have you

20
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,140
tried Miguel because this is a really

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:20,780
popular in a lie so that's where you get

22
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,759
it isn't I've been there but I don't

23
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,380
remember trying it no you remember

24
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,149
seeing all these like little food

25
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:31,399
vendors and then they sell the sausages

26
00:01:31,399 --> 00:01:33,080
and then there will be like oh these are

27
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,679
sausages with the Mayo gal flavor maybe

28
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,360
because I'm a vegetarian

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,179
I don't maybe it's a seasoning a lot of

30
00:01:41,179 --> 00:01:44,810
the time maybe that's why ok because if

31
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,819
they're using it as a seasoning it might

32
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:50,390
be for spicing a meat yes because I

33
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,750
heard it has a bit of a pepper taste you

34
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,759
add it what does it taste like well see

35
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,590
the thing is I don't really have a

36
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,080
sensitive taste but whatever I eat I

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,509
just feel like okay that's the semi and

38
00:02:02,509 --> 00:02:04,369
you were to ask me in detail how does it

39
00:02:04,369 --> 00:02:08,389
taste like just check-in journey yeah ok

40
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,729
well it's also used kind of like

41
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,400
medicine too right that's right I heard

42
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,800
that the essential oil it kind of has

43
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,069
like citrus smell to it and if you have

44
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:21,110
a card or something will problem with

45
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,270
your skin you can rub it on there and it

46
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:25,130
also helps with your digestion too I

47
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,170
think it's just kind of like ginger

48
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:29,120
because they say it also tastes a little

49
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,920
bit like ginger that's right

50
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,990
so next time you should definitely try

51
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,150
I'm sure I can get it outside of will I

52
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,100
too right I guess so actually I'm not

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,350
sure I'm sure you can I'm gonna get

54
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,360
anything online these days I guess so

55
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,770
yeah I guess you're right okay so let's

56
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:49,940
learn more about Macau Macau good for

57
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,670
the body good for the earth the district

00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:55,190
of Li is blessed with rich soil that

59
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,350
makes it possible for many plants to

60
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,190
thrive there

61
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,670
one such plant is Macau or mountain

62
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,700
pepper capable of growing in areas from

63
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,900
100 to 1,500 metres above sea level this

64
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,269
native shrub is prized for its unique

65
00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:14,090
qualities and favorable effects on human

66
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,500
and environmental health

67
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,600
today's lesson is called Maga good for

68
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:27,470
the body good for the earth part 1 hello

everyone my name is Jeff and I'm Mike

70
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,720
and yes we're talking about the Macau

71
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,840
which is not in any way even though it

72
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,470
sounds similar related to Macau and I

73
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,450
thought you were talking about Macau you

74
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,799
can go gamble there right

75
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,840
I thought they spelled the place wrong

76
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,790
and when I first read it but no this is

77
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,980
completely different this is not the

78
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,860
gambling place that that city near Hong

79
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,320
Kong with the casinos and hotels no no

80
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,570
no this is not a place it's a thing and

81
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,420
in fact it's a food and in fact it's

82
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,690
from here in Taiwan yeah the district of

83
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,000
wulai all you have to do to get some

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,150
Maga is go to ulla you don't have to get

85
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,840
on a plane and fly to Hong Kong or Macau

86
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,239
just go to who lie anyways the district

87
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,120
of ooh lie is blessed with rich soil

88
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,880
that makes it possible for many plants

89
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,900
to thrive there yes there's rich soil so

90
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,419
plants grow very well there they thrive

91
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:29,450
there they flourish there and yes one

92
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,900
such plant is Mogao or Mountain pepper

93
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,370
all right so now we have a bit of a

94
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,380
better idea what it is obviously it

95
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,110
grows on

96
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,300
it's a peppers it's a little spicy a

97
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,509
vegetable of some kind and yeah this is

98
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:48,870
a very hearty thing to grow it seems to

99
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,479
be really doing well in July and here we

100
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,659
kind of find out why capable of growing

101
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:59,759
in areas from 100 to 1500 meters above

102
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,270
sea level this native shrub is prized

103
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,000
for its unique qualities and favorable

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,610
effects on human and environmental

105
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,449
health

106
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,849
Wow so it grows in lots of areas right

107
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:14,069
down near the water near the the sea

108
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,069
level 100 meters right up to like way up

109
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:20,370
the side of a hill or a mountain 1,500

110
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,469
meters it does well in all of those

111
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:25,590
areas it's a shrub like a bush big

112
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,810
bigger than a plant smaller than a tree

113
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:30,449
but with woody branches kind of like a

114
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:33,990
tree but much smaller and it's very very

115
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,789
unusual special and really kind of cool

116
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:40,770
yep I couldn't have possibly said it any

117
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,500
better myself anyways before we take a

118
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,240
break here let's talk about the word

119
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,150
unique it's an adjective if something is

120
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:51,539
unique it's one of a kind okay there's

121
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:54,419
nothing else like it anywhere that being

122
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,060
said when you hear this word usually

123
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,159
people use it interchangeably with the

124
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:02,279
word special it does mean one-of-a-kind

125
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,229
but you can also use the word unique to

126
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:05,969
talk about something that's special

127
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:09,419
maybe unusual in a good way maybe

128
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,460
something that's original you can use

129
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,409
you can use this word unique to describe

130
00:06:13,409 --> 00:06:14,520
those sorts of things

131
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,979
for example the unique design of the

132
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:19,110
church makes it a popular spot for

133
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,150
tourists it doesn't look like other

134
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:24,330
churches so yet tourists like to take in

135
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,469
that particular church you're talking

136
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,270

185
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,190
using it as both a seasoning and a

186
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,530
medicine with a complex flavor that

187
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,110
combines hints of ginger lemongrass and

188
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,540
pepper the fruit may be consumed either

189
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,210
fresh steeped in hot water to make tea

190
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,320
or dried as the spice in cooking in fact

191
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,780
miguel appears in a wide variety of

192
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,030
traditional a tile and other Aboriginal

193
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,440
dishes from

194
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,870
filling soups made with wild game to

195
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:11,750
more delicate fare such as steamed fish

196
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,860
[Music]

197
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,740
we're going to almond Macau and we're

198
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,370
going to gamble right wrong today we're

199
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,880
talking about Macao mountain pepper now

200
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,150
the name Macau comes from the entire

201
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,790
people who for centuries have been

202
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:33,550
gathering the plants fruit and using it

203
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,660
as both a seasoning and a medicine mmm

204
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,850
interesting so native people this native

205
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:42,610
group the ITL one of the I believe 13

206
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,220
recognized native groups in Taiwan

207
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,170
they've been using this stuff for a long

208
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,140
time both for its healthy benefits and

209
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,630
also just for its delicious flavor in

210
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,880
their food let's find out about that

211
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,740
delicious flavor cuz it really does

212
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,680
sound quite wonderful with a complex

213
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,530
flavor complex meaning kind of

214
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:04,390
complicated you'll see why we use a word

215
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,520
like complex or complicated with a

216
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,070
complex flavor that combines hints of

217
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,010
ginger lemongrass and pepper

218
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,830
hmmm the fruit may be consumed either

219
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:17,860
fresh steeped in hot water to make tea

220
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,580
or dried as a spice in cooking that

221
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,170
would be the Mount and pepper part

222
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,760
that's this place the II use in

223
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,830
cooking's that great to flavor your food

224
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,300
so it can be used in lots of ways you

225
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,820
can use it fresh like eat it in a salad

226
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,430
you can use it to make tea I guess that

227
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:35,800
might be a dried version to or really

228
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,170
dry it and probably crush it to a powder

229
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,720
like a spice like you put in your soups

230
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,910
and other foods to give them more

231
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,460
interesting flavors so you can eat it

232
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,260
you can take it into your body you can

233
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,720
consume it in lots of different ways

234
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,060
depending on what you want to consume

235
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,670
when we talk about food we're talking

236
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,770
about eating the food okay so you

237
00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:00,040
consume food to give your body energy so

238
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,070
you can do stuff during the day consume

239
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,140
can be used in other ways it basically

240
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,870
means to use up something you know cars

241
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,770
consume of gas to drive or businesses

242
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,110
might consume wood and in order to make

243
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:16,150
furniture or something like that so

244
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,620
there's lots of different ways we can

245
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,730
use it but Jen

246
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,829
when we're talking about food the body

247
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:23,889
science we consume food now you wouldn't

248
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,630
say hey do you want to come and consume

249
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,029
lunch with us no you would ask people to

250
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:30,370
come and eat lunch with you as I said

251
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,920
it's more of a scientific type of word

252
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,199
for example according to some experts

253
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:39,310
you should consume 2 cups of fruit per

254
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:41,860
day you could say eat but you know yeah

255
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,510
here they're using the word consume

256
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,420
because you don't necessarily have to

257
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,180
eat it ok you could eat it but you could

258
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:51,459
also drink it ok so you're putting it in

259
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:53,290
your body you're ingesting it so we're

260
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:55,990
using this more general word consume now

261
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,070
more on Maga in fact Macau in a wide

262
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,940
variety of traditional attire and other

263
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,810
Aboriginal dishes from filling soups

264
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:11,170
made with wildgame to more delicate fare

265
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:14,079
such as steamed fish yes steamed fish

266
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,089
you steamed a fish that flesh will be

267
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:18,490
very very delicate it will fall off the

268
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,130
bone it might even fall off your fork or

269
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,350
it might fall out of your grasp as far

270
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,199
as your chopsticks are concerned so

271
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,449
that's what it means to have delicate

272
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:30,850
fare if something is delicate it can be

273
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,579
easily broken like the flesh of a

274
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,740
steamed fish now on the other hand let's

275
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,880
say you have wild game like wild boar or

276
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,829
wild deer or something like that that

277
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,380
meat might be somewhat tougher and

278
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,829
harder to break it's not going to be

279
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:49,510
delicate by the way the word delicate is

280
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,920
an adjective and like I said before

281
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,690
we're talking about something that's

282
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,819
delicate talking about something that is

283
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:57,610
easily broken ok

284
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,279
for example Ben really enjoyed the

285
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,279
delicate flavor of the wine yes Ben

286
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,589
enjoyed that wine but he probably

287
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:07,690
wouldn't be able to taste that if he ate

288
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,120
a food let's say that hey stronger

289
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,860
flavor he wouldn't be able to sense that

290
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,430
delicate flavor anymore ok so we might

291
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,829
also say light it's a light flavor it's

292
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:20,079
not a strong or powerful flavor it's

293
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,240
would be easily broken by another flame

294
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,610
right ok so it's it's a light flavor

295
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,560
it's not too strong as well that's the

296
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,600
idea there interesting all right let's

297
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,220
take a break and then we'll be back with

298
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,570
more about the

299
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,140

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,890
Macau is also valued as a medicine due

343
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:32,280
to its healing and comforting properties

344
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,750
essential oil made from a GAO has a

345
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,180
refreshing citrus smell and often

346
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,890

351
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:57,149
is delicious okay it's got a very

352
00:15:57,149 --> 00:16:00,089
complicated complex flavor but there's

353
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:03,269
more it can also be used as a medicine

354
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:06,570
yeah Maga is also valued as a medicine

355
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,199
due to its healing and comforting

356
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,779
properties so this kind of sounds like

357
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:16,230
Macau is Taiwan's answer to garlic

358
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:18,329
yeah people use garlic as a seasoning on

359
00:16:18,329 --> 00:16:20,190
food it makes other foods taste even

360
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,680
better but it's also very good for you

361
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,660
sometimes people do use garlic as a

362
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,570
special herb with medicinal purposes

363
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,589
yeah that's right it's got a lot of

364
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:30,120
vitamins in it but the good thing about

365
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,389
Macau is it smells better than garlic

366
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:34,380
you don't like the smell

367
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,149
oh I like the smell of garlic but you

368
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:38,060
wouldn't have garlic smelling perfume

369
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,699
nothing like that Melling smoked a soap

370
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,949
for your hands that wouldn't really work

371
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,750
so well but with Macau that is a

372
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,170
possibility we read essential oil made

373
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,560
from Macau has a refreshing citrus smell

374
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,560
and often features in personal care and

375
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,019
beauty products yeah a nice citrus smell

376
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,600
it's probably better than essence of

377
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,000
garlic so yes I imagine Macau is

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,819
probably a better additive when beauty

379
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:07,589
products and stuff like that are

380
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,699
concerned

381
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,209
colognes perfumes creams the list goes

382
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:13,109
on and on

383
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,970
Macau is probably better for those

384
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:17,189
things than garlic is anyways though

385
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:20,699
Macau remember can be used as a medicine

386
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,609
yeah applied on the body it can aid

387
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:27,359
digestion relieve skin reactions and

388
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,320
also reduce muscle pain okay folks it's

389
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,850
official Macau can do it all it can even

390
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,910
help with digestion that's what they say

391
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,400
a digestion when we use this word it's a

392
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,799
noun and it talks about how our bodies

393
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,160
process food our digestion system would

394
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,960
be everything from you know how the food

395
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,880
gets down into our stomachs certainly

396
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,180
the stomach the

397
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,130
the intestines where the food gets

398
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:56,620
squeezed through before it all comes out

399
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,430
the other end

400
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,260
that's digestion so if you have a

401
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,960
stomach problem if you had some spicy

402
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,940
food and you don't feel well a little

403
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:05,920
bit later oh I'm having some digestion

404
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,770

405
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,960
