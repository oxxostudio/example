old houses and then abandoned farms it

136
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,440
doesn't sound like these farms are going

137
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,539
to be abandoned for long they're being

138
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:20,030

any time soon yes if something has been

143
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,870
abandoned someone has left something

144
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,090
somewhere and they have no intention of

145
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,330
returning and picking up or you've had

146
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,830
you have a house or a farm or something

147
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,620

yes abandoned would be the verb

151
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,260
abandoned here would be an ad

152
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,920

153
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,740

00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,200
about this famous resident of my Orca in

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,440
one of these villages valide Musa you'll

240
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,540
find a monastery where the famous

241
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,630
composer Frederic Chopin and his lover

242
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,250
George Sand spent the winter of 1838

243
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,890
that's a mat that's absolutely amazing

244
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,250
so they stayed in this monastery back in

245
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,170
1838 in the winter of hiss of course as

246
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:53,790
we mentioned Chopin is a famous

247
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,760
classical music composer probably also a

248
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,150
piano player a pianist but a composer is

249
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,340
what he's most well known for what is a

250
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,770
composer this noun simply means someone

251
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,600
who writes music that's it you're the

252
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,730
person who sits down and either works it

253
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,680
out on the piano or something writes it

254
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,020
down on the music paper on the notation

255
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,000
and stuff like that when we think of

256
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,100
composers we have think Mozart Beethoven

257
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,180
Chaka

258
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,270
skee Chopin Bach people like that sure

259
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,430
you could be a composer of modern pop

260
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:26,070
music we might call you a songwriter or

261
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,990
something like that because composers

262
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,750
are mainly focused on the music not the

263
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,670
word so much so that's why we might

264
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,760
separate the terms we use Olivia

265
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,640
for example Olivia studied late 18th

266
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,820
century composers in school so that

267
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,320
would have been like Mozart or someone

268
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,790
like that is that what she made your

269
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,980
didn't it interesting I don't know if

270
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,990
you can do that but hey you can take a

271
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,820

272
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,060
of these composers now as well as now

273
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,000
being a museum devoted to the great

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,970

319
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,330
going to move on and talk about a really

320
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,880
important city there in my Orca in fact

321
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,640
we're gonna talk about the capital of my

322
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,190
York ok yeah of course it's good to

323
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,620
visit the biggest city on the island no

324
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,600
matter where you go you'll probably find

325
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,610
a little bit more going on there so

326
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,920
let's find out about Palma Majorca is

327
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,560
lively capital is also home to many

328
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:26,920
museums historic buildings and galleries

329
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,750
yeah you'd expect to find things like

330
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,330
that in a big city in a capital city

331
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,089
more of the cultural stuff will be

332
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,270
located there in the capital of my Orca

333
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,890
so does this mean it's a country and

334
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,680
that's the where the president is no

335
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,380
remember my orc is a part of Spain and

336
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,930
the capital of Spain is Madrid which is

337
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,000
not on this Islands which is not on the

338
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,710
island here when we're talking about

339
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,450
capital and we're talking about an

340
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:56,170
important city in a place that houses

341
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:59,530
the government of that place ok so let's

342
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,740
say there's a mayor in Majorca chances

343
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:05,140
are they live there in the capital Bal

344
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,000
the government people live there in the

345
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,610
capital or at least work in the capital

346
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,460
now one note the capital of a place is

347
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,160
not always the biggest city in that

348
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,010
place let's say like New York City is

349
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,280
not the capital of New York State for

350
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,020
instance ok it might be the cultural

351
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,060
capital the financial capital the

352
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,430
capital in every other way but the

353
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,500
government Center in New York they're

354
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,290
the capital is actually a city called

355
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:34,900
Albany anyways for example Sacramento is

356
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,300
the capital of California not San

357
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,350
Francisco not Los Angeles not San Diego

358
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,580
Sacramento other things you might see in

359
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,590
Palma a gallery or probably

360
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,990
Merl gallery's this noun is basically a

361
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,600
word we use for a space that is used for

362
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,390
viewing art alright usually it's a large

363
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,060
open space now it might not be a museum

364
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,060
a museum would have galleries those big

365
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,190
rooms where they hang the paintings but

366
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,260
museums are more places for people to

367
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,050
come and look at old famous works of art

368
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,240
and you can't really buy things that you

369
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,460
see there but in a gallery it's kind of

370
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,370
like a shop for art so you'd go to the

371
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,020
gallery they might have a special

372
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,390
showing and in many cases if you like

373
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,970
the painting and have a lot of money you

374
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,670
can buy the paintings on the wall in a

375
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,410
gallery you would also go to a gallery

376
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,680
to see sculptures and 3d art and all

377
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,540
kinds of things like that but if it's

378
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,910
art you appreciate with your eyes you'll

379
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,610
probably go to a gallery to see it if

380
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:36,550
not a museum for example Sophia likes to

381
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,860
visit art galleries in her free time

382
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,130
that's a fun thing to do okay moving on

383
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,740
here in these galleries here you'll be

384
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,410
able to see works by great Spanish

385
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,680
painters such as Picasso Dali and Miro

386
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,950

what is the main draw of Majorca and you

417
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,140
can't say shovelling I'd say the main

418
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,570
draw of Majorca is that you get to enjoy

419
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:21,180
all the wonder of Spain but in a much

420
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,550
smaller package because you know
