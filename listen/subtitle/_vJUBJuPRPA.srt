00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,040
so

00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:28,400
[Music]

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
hi everyone this is karen hey everybody 

5
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,320
i'm shane today we're looking at part

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,920
one of soybeans

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,040
the miracle crop and the vocabulary

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,840
words are

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,800
consume consume the average person

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,000
consumes over

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
three grams of salt per day reputation

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,399
reputation reports that employees were

13
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,600
treated poorly

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,120
have ruined the company's reputation

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
demand demand rory complained that his

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,719
new girlfriend demands constant

17
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,920
attention production production

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,640
global steel production fell in the

19
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,760
first three months of 2020

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,040
content content nuts have a high

21
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,320
fat content so they provide a lot of

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,520
energy

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,119
so we're talking about soybeans soybeans

24
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,799
if you're a vegetarian

25
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,720
soybeans are your best friend really

26
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,360
because i'm a vegetarian and soy beans

27
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,560
can be made into

28
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,920
so many things and it's high in protein

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,240
too

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,799
and oil so you can get your protein oil

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,600
from soybeans

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,520
yeah you can replace meat with soybean

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,600
or soybean products like

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,960
soy milk tofu

35
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,600
and tempeh and they can use soy

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,200
texturized soy to kind of like make

37
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,799
imitation meats

38
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,960
so you can still have the same texture

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,000
of eating meat

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,560
but without hurting animals that is

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,600
amazing but

42
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
let me ask you this before you became a

43
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,079
vegetarian did you eat a lot of soybeans

44
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:02,799
or was it

45
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,119
after you became a vegetarian it was

46
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,000
really more

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,720
after i stopped eating meat i realized

48
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,120
the benefits and how wonderful

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,840
soy beans were mm-hmm and there's so

50
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,360
many things that you can do

51
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,599
with soy beans too right they can be

52
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,280
used like because the oil

53
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,280
in there that can be used i think even

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,400
henry ford

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,560
used soybean to kind of make like

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,640
plastics or stuff for his cars

57
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,959
i know that's pretty amazing so it's not

58
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,239
only for eating

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,640
yeah it's very very versatile and you

60
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,680
can feed it to

61
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400
cows and things like that to make them

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,080
grow bigger so you can also

63
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,400
make more meat so everybody likes

64
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,200
soybeans

65
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,599
i love soybeans too and i love soy milk

66
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,280
okay let's learn more about the miracle

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,720
crop all right

68
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,840
soybeans the miracle crop

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,319
nature has gifted us with a variety of

70
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,840
crops but only one

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,480
the humble soybean has earned the title

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,159
of miracle crop

73
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,040
what makes this plant so special to

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,840
begin with

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,400
soybeans are highly versatile which

76
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,680
means they can be grown

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,080
in a number of climate conditions and

78
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,400
consumed in different ways

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,560
when soybean seeds first arrived in

80
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,840
america from china

81
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,159
in the mid 18th century they were

82
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,319
planted for the purpose of making soy

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,440
sauce

84
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,519
during the civil war when coffee beans

85
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:26,720
were scarce

86
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,840
soldiers used soybeans to make a coffee

87
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
substitute

88
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,120
today's lesson is called soybeans

89
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,800
the

90
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,280
[Music]

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,120
miracle crop part one

92
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,319
hello everyone my name is jeff and

93
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,519
i'm mike yes soybeans they are a

94
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,080
miracle they're a gift from the heavens

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,159
or some god from god

96
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:02,159
all right so if we say something is a

97
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,920
miracle it's almost

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,360
magical it's amazing it's incredible

99
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,239
why are we talking about a bean as being

100
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,200
a miracle

101
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,319
crop well probably because soybeans

102
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,199
unlike some of those other lazier beans

103
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,160
that don't really

104
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,839
do very much is really great soybeans

105
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,040
can be used in

106
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,560
lots of different ways you know

107
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,759
white beans fava beans kidney beans

108
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,479
they're just

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,759
beans the soybean though it does more

110
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,400
than your average bean

111
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
okay it's pretty amazing we're gonna

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,479
read about it for two days

113
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,360
you couldn't read about green beans for

114
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,639
two days

115
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,160
if you're going to put it that way all

116
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,560
right yeah those other beans

117
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,600
are lazy i gotta try harder

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,120
anyways yes the soybean is very

119
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,639
versatile anyways let's go ahead and

120
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,560
start reading nature has gifted us

121
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,600
with a variety of crops

122
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,400
but only one the humble soybean has

123
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,020
earned the title of

124
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,000
[Music]

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,600
miracle crop crop

126
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,880
from god now

127
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,400
what makes this plant so

128
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,680
special i guess that's the question

129
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,720
of the day well we're going to find out

130
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,280
so yeah

131
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,400
what makes soybeans so special so much

132
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,360
of a miracle

133
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,720
it says well to begin with soybeans

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,759
are highly versatile or versatile as

135
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,479
some people

136
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,520
say what does that mean which means they

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,479
can be grown

138
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,520
in a number of climate conditions and

139
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,039
consumed in different ways so there you

140
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:55,440
go

141
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,560
two reasons why the soybean is so

142
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,280
great it can be grown in the number of

143
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,440
climate conditions basically you don't

144
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:03,840
need

145
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,560
perfect weather in only one part of the

146
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,600
world to grow

147
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,160
soybeans they can be grown all over the

148
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,840
place in rainy places

149
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,759
and dry places cool places warm places

150
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,800
and they can be consumed in different

151
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
ways we can use

152
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,639
soybeans of course when we talk about

153
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,600
consume

154
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
we talk about eating things you will

155
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
consume food

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,000
to give your body energy but we can also

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,199
use consume

158
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,360
when we talk about other things that we

159
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,639
use up cars

160
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,000
consume gasoline to give them energy if

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,360
you make a fire

162
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,080
you will be consuming wood to create the

163
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,600
flames in the heat

164
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,319
that make the fire so we're using the

165
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,280
using these

166
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,560
things up often in a way to make energy

167
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,800
or something like that so we're eating

168
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,240
soybeans but we're also

169
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,639
using them in other ways we'll find out

170
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,680
all about that

171
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,080
very soon but look at this word consume

172
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
in our example sentence which says

173
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,599
the average person consumes

174
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,039
over three grams of salt per day

175
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,280
so yeah we eat it and we use it in our

176
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,479
bodies

177
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,000
okay moving on yes when soybeans

178
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,840
seeds first arrived in america

179
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,039
from china in the mid 18th

180
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,160
century they were planted for the

181
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,520
purpose of making

182
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,680
soy sauce by the way i've heard

183
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,360
that the bean the soy bean actually got

184
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,880
its name

185
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,680
from the sauce and not the other way

186
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,240
around

187
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,440
oh interesting yes people made soy sauce

188
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,080
with this

189
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
plant and later on they said hey the

190
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,360
bean that we need

191
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,960
to make this sauce let's call it

192
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,280
the soybean because we make soy sauce

193
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,160
with it

194
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
very very interesting so there you go

195
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,680
people were putting that

196
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
wonderful salty black soy sauce on their

197
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,960
food a long time ago and then

198
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,879
about a hundred years later during the

199
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,000
civil war

200
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,599
when coffee beans were scarce soldiers

201
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,720
used soybeans to make a coffee

202
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,759
substitute so here's use number two a

203
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,879
time of war

204
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,120
often things become scarce they're hard

205
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,080
to find you can't get them so easily

206
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,000
soldiers still wanted some kind of

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,360
delicious drink

208
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,440
delicious hot drink they couldn't find

209
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,800
coffee beans so

210
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,440
they roasted up some soy beans and used

211
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,479
those to make

212
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,880
a coffee substitute something like

213
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,519
coffee

214
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,719
that they could drink with their

215
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,679
breakfast i don't think so

216
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,519
no it would be different there you go

217
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,679
use number two though of soybeans

218
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,120
already let's take a break and then

219
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,839
we'll be back

220
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,399
with more of the miracle crop hello

221
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,880
and beauty soybeans the

222
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,760
the film made him an international

223
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,480
superstar

224
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,440
and international superstar means

225
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,399
for the purpose of jasha means

226
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,040
elijah the event was held for the

227
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,760
purpose

228
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
of raising money for children with

229
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
cancer

230
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
without

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,680
soybeans the miracle crop the reputation

232
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,839
of soybeans as a miracle crop

233
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,800
took root in the early 1900s when their

234
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,120
many uses became known

235
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,839
the scientist george washington carver

236
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,360
discovered that soybeans

237
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,680
were a valuable source of protein and

238
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,720
oil

239
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,920
in the 1930s automobile producer henry

240
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,560
ford

241
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,959
even built cars with plastic made from

242
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,600
soybeans

243
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,079
okay these days soybeans have a

244
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,519
fantastic

245
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,560
reputation people think of them

246
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,760
as being a

247
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,120
a miracle crop a crop

248
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,600
from god now the reputation of soybeans

249
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,800
as a miracle crop took

250
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,320
root or this is where things got started

251
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,680
in the early 1900s when their

252
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,200
many uses became known

253
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,720
by the way your reputation is what

254
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,399
people commonly think of you okay

255
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,200
when someone mentions your name the

256
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,839
first

257
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,720
things that come into someone else's

258
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,320
mind about you

259
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,720
that's your reputation do they think

260
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,040
good things about you or bad things

261
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,240
about you

262
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,519
that is your reputation for example

263
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,720
reports that employees were treated

264
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,760
poorly

265
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,040
have ruined the company's reputation

266
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,000
before people

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,639
thought that they were really nice

268
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,639
people working there at that company but

269
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,720
it turns out that they were

270
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,440
really nasty to their employees so

271
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,320
people thought

272
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,959
you know what forget them they're in the

273
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,600
past

274
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
we don't like those people anymore their

275
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
reputation

276
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,720
is ruined forever okay

277
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,279
so the public doesn't think good things

278
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,920
about

279
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,480
that company but they do think good

280
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,959
things about soybeans now we saw early

281
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:27,360
on

282
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,760
soybeans were used to make soy sauce and

283
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,120
then kind of this

284
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,279
fake coffee but it was only about a

285
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,720
hundred years ago

286
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,680
that people really began to discover how

287
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,320
useful

288
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,279
soybeans were and there's one person in

289
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,320
particular

290
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,120
who was very interested in exploring the

291
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,440
uses of soybeans it says

292
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,279
the scientist george washington carver

293
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,320
discovered that soybeans were a valuable

294
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,079
source of protein

295
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,279
and oil ah things you might not think

296
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,800
about a bean you might

297
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,880
you know make something out of it eat it

298
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,240
put it in hot water

299
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,120
drink it but using it to make protein

300
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,680
you know as

301
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,760
as a way to give your body a lot of

302
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,040
healthy nutrients

303
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,920
it's just a bean it's not a big piece of

304
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
meat that's where you normally might get

305
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,199
protein from an

306
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,000
oil now that's totally different oil for

307
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,120
cooking or

308
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,839
oil for doing other things with and mike

309
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,680
it doesn't stop there

310
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,000
in the 1930s automobile producer

311
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
henry ford even built

312
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,399
cars with plastic

313
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,639
made from soybeans wow you could recycle

314
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,440
those cars

315
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,639
plastic or you could eat them or you

316
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,320
could eat them or make them into a

317
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,120
delicious coffee

318
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,839
that too possible all right folks with

319
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,839
that it's time for us to take a short

320
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,839
break but don't go away

321
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,400
we'll be right back

322
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,520
[Music]

323
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,639
foreign

324
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,240
soybeans the miracle crop after world

325
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,880
war ii

326
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,279
the united states became wealthier and

327
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,120
more people demanded meat on their

328
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,160
plates

329
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,839
to support this increased meat

330
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,800
production farmers used soybean meal to

331
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,240
feed their livestock

332
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,079
because of its cheap cost and high

333
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,839
protein content

334
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,240
all the while soy remained a steady part

335
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,839
of americans diets

336
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,839
though mostly in refined forms

337
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,519
okay let's move forward a little bit

338
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:28,800
after world war

339
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,240
ii the united states became wealthier

340
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,759
and more people demanded meat on their

341
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,959
plates

342
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,160
no more of these vegetables and potatoes

343
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,600
and such

344
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,880
i want meat we're wealthy now

345
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,240
give me meat yeah that's what they were

346
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,320
that's what they're demanding when you

347
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,839
demand something you

348
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,720
ask for something and you won't take no

349
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,279
for an

350
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,160
answer you're basically saying give this

351
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,040
to me

352
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,240
and if you don't well i won't be happy

353
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,400
about it right so people will demand

354
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,520
their rights

355
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,839
they will demand to speak to the manager

356
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,079
if they're really angry in a store and

357
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
they want to make a big complaint

358
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,000

it happens

364
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,039
that's what they're demanding so people

365
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,880
you know back then they had a bit more

366
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,599
money

367
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,840
and they said you know growing up i only

368
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
ate chicken once a year

369
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,240
but now i want steak every day and if

370
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,720
you don't give me steak i'm going to

371
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,600
ask for it again basically shop that

372
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,960
pork shop's okay too

373
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,440
so anyway people wanted more meat there

374
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,320
was a huge

375
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,600
demand for it or a very a large

376
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,760
group of people were saying this is what

377
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,160
we want please bring it to us

378
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,360
for example rory complained that his new

379
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,039
girlfriend demands

380
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,240
constant attention anyways back to

381
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,160
the soybean now to support this

382
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,679
increased meat production remember

383
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,120
everybody in america wanted me

384
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,679
to support this increased meat

385
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,559
production

386
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,840
farmers used soybean

387
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,679
meal to feed their livestock

388
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,880
because of its cheap cost and

389
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,320
high protein content how about

390
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,799
that by the way production that's the

391
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:31,600
noun

392
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,320
that comes from the verb produce when

393
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,960
you

394
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,600
produce something you make something

395
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,240
usually

396
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,160
in large numbers okay production is the

397
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,039
act of making or producing stuff that's

398
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,360
all there is to it for example

399
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,480
global steel production fell

400
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,360
in the first three months of 2020

401
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,320
people weren't making that much steel oh

402
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,720
okay

403
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,880
but they were making a lot of meat back

404
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,840
during the time

405
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,240
after the war so of course they needed a

406
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,520
lot of livestock

407
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,160
pigs and cows and you know animals to

408
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,760
make the meat and when we talk about

409
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,559
soybean

410
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,120
meal here we're not using meal like

411
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,919
breakfast

412
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,320
lunch dinner these are the meals you

413
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,760
might eat here we're talking about

414
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,039
prepared food

415
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,520
that we feed to farm animals that's the

416
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,160
kind of

417
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
meal we're talking about here so

418
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,320
basically they were using soybean

419
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,720
to feed to pigs and cows and things like

420
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,440
that it was

421
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,120
cheap and it had a high protein content

422
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,960
all right protein is something good that

423
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,559
we get in our food in

424
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,760
in meat we might have vitamin content

425
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,400
in vegetables and fruits and things like

426
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,080
that so what is content

427
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,120
it's an amount of something inside

428
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,679
of something else basically if you talk

429
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,799
about this thing

430
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,280
what is inside it what is it all made up

431
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:53,919
of

432
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,320
that is the content so we can talk about

433
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,000
the content of food

434
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,400
in terms of protein and vitamins and

435
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,039
minerals

436
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,880
we could talk about the content of a

437
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,280
book about oh it's a it's an adventure

438
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,919
book for children with lots of magic and

439
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,320
and exciting scenes that's the content

440
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,960
that's what's

441
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,000
inside this thing for example when we

442
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,200
get back to the uh

443
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,480
the idea of food content nuts have a

444
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:18,960
high

445
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,080
fat content so they provide a lot of

446
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,720
energy

447
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,120
that's why nuts can be quite healthy but

448
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,080
also fatty

449
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,200
anyways all the while soy remained

450
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,840
a steady part of americans

451
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,679
diets though mostly

452
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,880
in refined form so they're not just

453
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,440
eating bowls of soybeans eating boy

454
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
they were not eating bowls of soybeans

455
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:44,960
they were

456
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,480
eating soy but in refined

457
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,520
forms how interesting all right folks

458
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,679
that's it for today's lesson

459
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,039
and it's time for us to say bye

460
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:03,840
bye go get some soy sauce

461
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,200
pam spent 20 minutes looking for her

462
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,320
sunglasses

463
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,400

464
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,720
wearing them on top of her head

465
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,440
all the while

466
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,840
remains done

467
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,039
