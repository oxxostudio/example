[Music]

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,059
so

3
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:28,400
[Music]

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,320
hi everyone this is karen hey everybody

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,640
i am shane today we're looking at part

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,880
one of our story and it's called the

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,399
hounds of fate

8
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,800
that's right and the vocabulary words

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,600
are

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,040
exhausted exhausted the farmer is

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,600
exhausted from working in the fields all

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,640
day

13
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,079
approach approach pam raised the slipper

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,719
and slowly approached the cockroach on

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,960
her coffee table

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,800
assume assume the mob was after john

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,160
so he moved to a small town and assumed

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,519
a false name remark remark

19
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
dave remarked that he only slept for

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,560
four hours last night

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000
in form inform inform jane informed her

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,479
boss

23
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,680
of her decision to quit so we're looking

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,240
at the story called the hounds of fate

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,600
right that's correct so we have this guy

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,880
named martin martin so martin

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,640
seems like he's homeless and he's just

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,920
poor and he's wandering around in the

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,960
country

30
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,720
and he doesn't know if he's going to

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,079
make it through the night

32
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,400
he's exhausted he's super excited

33
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,040
starving but then he sees something

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,320
a farmhouse yes but he gets there and he

35
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,880
doesn't even have enough energy to knock

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,640
on the door

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,840
but somebody comes out and sees him and

38
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,240
this

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,840
old man is named george right

40
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,880
and then what does george say he said oh

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,719
master tom that's right you're back

42
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,920
i knew you would be back wait a minute

43
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,758
his name is martin not my mom

44
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,800
so they think he's somebody named tom

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,319
but does martin correct him he doesn't

46
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,760
correct him because

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,120
there's a warm house there there's food

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,920
and they called him master so that must

49
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,319
mean that he was pretty important there

50
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,400
so they'll take good care of him

51
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,160
so he keeps his mouth shut

52
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,560
so she decided to stay for a little

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,440
while

54
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,920
i guess i would too yeah if i were

55
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
hungry and i were cold i

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,239
really were desperate at least get some

57
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:42,959
food

58
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,200
first and get warm and then maybe

59
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,319
explain later

60
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,840
that's right all right let's see what

61
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,360
happens on day two

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,160
enjoy the story

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,000
the hounds of fate it was a rainy autumn

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
afternoon when martin stoner found

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
himself wandering aimlessly in the

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,879
country

67
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
he was exhausted starving and had no

68
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,720
idea whether he would even make it

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,920
through the night

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,519
he could feel the hounds of fate

71
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,890
catching up with him

72
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,800
[Music]

73
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,080
today's lesson is called the hounds

74
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,200
of fate part one

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,480
hello everyone my name is jeff

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,519
my name is mike so this is our story and

77
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,080
what a

78
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,680
title our story has the hounds

79
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,239
of fate well fate is basically your

80
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,000
fortune your future

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,480
what will happen to you and you can't

82
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,760
escape

83
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,680
you can't escape it that's right if you

84
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,920
go to a fortune teller and they say

85
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,720
you will die in five years and you say

86
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
what can i do to change that i don't

87
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,599
want to die

88
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,680
they'll say you can't change it it is

89
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,720
your fate

90
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,799
it only happens in stories don't worry

91
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,799
but that's basically a future that's

92
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,120
like

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,840
written in stone it's been decided by

94
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,360
the gods or whatever

95
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,920
and of course in stories it will mean

96
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,879
that the hero

97
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,879
or the bad guy something was going to

98
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,519
happen to them and it probably won't be

99
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,080
good what does this have to do with

100
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,640
hounds

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,760
towns are big hunting dogs

102
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,199
right what the hounds of faith what what

103
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,519
it probably means that something is

104
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,199
going to chase you to your

105
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,240
death nothing you can do about it kind

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,800
of

107
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,600
it's not good if the fortune teller says

108
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
you will be chased by the hounds of

109
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,960
fate until you die in five years

110
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
you should probably buy life insurance

111
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,160
your fate

112
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,600
follows you and there's nothing you can

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
do about it yeah that's right don't make

114
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,120
any blood it follows you like a hound

115
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,840

116
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,639

to

up with him

174
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,279

on the couch

176
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,240

on

178
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,200
the hounds of fate just when it seemed

179
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
he couldn't go any further

180
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,959
he came upon a farmhouse he approached

181
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,800
the door which opened before he could

182
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,920
even knock

183
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,000

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,040
martin entered the house happy to assume

188
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,200
the role of tom if it meant a meal to

189
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,040
eat and a bed to sleep in

190
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,200

meat cheese and bread

192
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,040
[Music]

193
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,480
all right so the hounds of fate

194
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,519
are on this stoner fella and

195
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,959
just just when it seemed he couldn't go

196
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,320
any further

197
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,600
he came upon a farmhouse now

198
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,399
remember he's exhausted and hungry so

199
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,760
he's thinking

200
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,120
maybe i can sleep here maybe i can get a

201
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,079
bite to eat

202
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,240
absolutely he definitely needs a place

203
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,120
to rest

204
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,160
and a farmhouse is as good as any place

205
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,079
so he approached the door

206
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,519
of the farmhouse which opened before he

207
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,399
could even

208
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
knock ooh creepy so he walks up to this

209
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,560
farmhouse or he approaches

210
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,120
the door of it and before he can knock

211
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,839
the door

212
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,480
opens slowly that's very mysterious and

213
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,120
strange

214
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,800
because of course you would expect to

215
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,320
approach a door and

216
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,279
knock on it or ring the bell before the

217
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:31,680
door

218
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,640
opens right to approach is just to go

219
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,320
near to something to

220
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,839
and to go closer to it to go towards it

221
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,920
if you're walking towards your house and

222
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,720
you're getting

223
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,880
nearer and nearer especially in the the

224
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,040
last few steps before you reach your

225
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,839
front door

226
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,240
you are approaching something if someone

227
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,360
approaches you

228
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,519
they are walking towards you not away

229
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,639
from you towards you for example pam

230
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,519
raised the slipper and slowly approached

231
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,880
the cockroach

232
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,360
on her coffee table she picked up a

233
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
slipper or a shoe

234
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,639
and she has to walk towards the

235
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,800
cockroach to smash it

236
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
with her shoe she can't reach it from

237
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,279
the other side of the room so there he

238
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,800
is he's approaching the door

239
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,720
he's about to knock and suddenly the

240
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,399
door starts to open

241
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,120
before he knocks on it who's there

242
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,240
what's going on

243
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,839
an old man named george

244
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,360
welcomed the weary martin martin stoner

245
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,399
and says come

246
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,839
in master tom tom

247
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,519
i knew you would come back

248
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,720
one of these days tom he called him

249
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,760
tom he called him master master tom

250
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,240
okay well master something he used to

251
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,959
call like

252
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,040
younger men right instead of calling him

253
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,519
mister they would call a master

254
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,480
but his name's martin it's not tom so

255
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,959
this is very confusing but remember

256
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,079
martin is exhausted he's hungry he just

257
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,880
needs a place to rest so he doesn't care

258
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,079
if they call him jane as long as he can

259
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,399
sit down martin entered that column any

260
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,160
name he just wants to sit down

261
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,519
martin entered the house happy to assume

262
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,560
the role of tom if it meant a meal to

263
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,079
eat and a bed to sleep

264
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:22,959
in call me susan call me mary yeah call

265
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,079
me barnaby

266
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,560
i don't care i want food and i want to

267
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,519
sit down

268
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,800
i'm exhausted and starving i've

269
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,360
i'll be whoever you want yes i'll be

270
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,440
i'll be whoever you want me to be

271
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,600
whatever just get me something to eat

272
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,959
and a place to sleep

273
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,600
anyways let's talk about the verb assume

274
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,639
if you assume

275
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,760
something is true okay

276
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,880
usually you decide something is

277
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,160
the case or is true before

278
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,639
you have all the facts okay you assume

279
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,399
something is true even though it might

280
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,519
not be true

281
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,199
here though he says that he's happy to

282
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,320
assume

283
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,880
the role of tom that means he's happy to

284
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,079
play this role

285
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,920
to take this role that's the idea here

286
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,000
for example the mob was after john

287
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,279
so he moved to a small town

288
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,800
and assumed a false name

289
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,240
he took a false name he started going by

290
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,920
a different name anyways

291
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,320
he got that meal he did yeah call him

292
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
tom call him whatever but just

293
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,600
give me some food and a place to rest so

294
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,839
that's what happened he was promptly

295
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,199
served a supper

296
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,639
of cold meat cheese and bread

297
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,040
just what a starving person would want

298
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,920
to eat

299
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,320
and this happened quickly or promptly so

300
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,560
not a lot of questions not a lot of tom

301
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,519
where have you been

302
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,160
uh he didn't have to make up a big lie

303
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,240
he just said yeah i'm tom okay sure

304
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,880
whatever and they gave him food and

305
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,480
that's what happened so

306
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,880
confusing but at this point martin's not

307
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,600
worried

308
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,839
he's just happy to be eating his food

309
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,519
now we'll take a break and then we'll be

310
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,720
back and find out

311
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,600
what happens with martin tom and all

312
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,000
this

313
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,639
strange stuff

314
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,970
[Music]

315
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,519
they came upon a bear during their hike

316
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,360
these four years the old man remarked

317
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,520
he left to inform tom's aunt that they

318
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,960
had a guest

319
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,039
she'd always said they'd take tom in if

320
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,320
he ever returned

321
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,640
however she refused to speak to or look

322
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,760
at him again

323
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,919
after supper martin was led to tom's

324
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,000
room and he had a good night's sleep

325
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,679
the first in a very long time

326
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,160
okay so master tom

327
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,200
i thought we were dealing with a

328
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,360
character named

329
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,880
martin stoner who is being

330
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,720
hounded by the hounded by fate or the

331
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,559
the hounds of faith well that's they

332
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,559
were after him that's what was happening

333
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,880
but luckily he found this farmhouse they

334
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,200
welcomed him in like he was some

335
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,240
long-lost person named tom but he didn't

336
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,720
care he was tired and hungry so

337
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,120
he's eating his meat and cheese and

338
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,919
bread he's finally getting some food

339
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,640
and as he's eating the old man who lives

340
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,880
in the farmhouse who welcomed him in who

341
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,400
called him tom

342
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,640
starts to talk to him and this old man

343
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,679
says you

344
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,880
little change these four years the old

345
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
man remarked in this kind of

346
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,440
old timey english hume little change

347
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,280
these four years master

348
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,640
tom says this old man or he remarks when

349
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,000
you remark this verb

350
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,480
basically means you you say something

351
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,600
you comment

352
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,919
on something probably something you're

353
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:16,880
seeing or a

354
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,679
pin an opinion you have what you think

355
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,919
about what's going on you might remark

356
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,919
about the beautiful weather we're having

357
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:24,960
today or

358
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,120
remark about what a lovely song they're

359
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,320
playing over there

360
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,400
so it's basically just your opinion or

361
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,440
your comment

362
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,600
on something that's going on or

363
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,080
happening around you for example dave

364
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,960
remarked

365
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,080
that he only slept for four hours last

366
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,880
night it's

367
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,200
interesting it might relate to what's

368
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,240
going on

369
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,559
why dave's yawning all the time and

370
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,360
seems a little

371
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,440
slow today but it's not the most

372
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,039
important thing in the world

373
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,880
it's just a little comment though so

374
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,160
there's this man he's

375
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,640
looking at this young martin or tom

376
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,840
eating and says oh

377
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,559
you know you you you kind of look pretty

378
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:00,960
good

379
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,280
he said something he remarked something

380

392
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,400
jane informed her boss of her decision

393
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,280
to quit i've decided that this is what i

394
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,320
want to do

395
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,559
and i'm telling you about it now i'm

396
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,400
informing you of it

397
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,600
right now anyways

398
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,400
while tom or martin while they're alone

399
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,520
what happens next i don't know so let's

400
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,720
go ahead

401
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,679
and read on all right so the and we're

402
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,120
now with the aunt of

403
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,480
tom or who they they think is martin

404
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,840
she'd always said they'd take tom in

405
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,120
if he ever returned however

406
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,640
she refused to speak to or look at him

407
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,000
again very very interesting so this is

408
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,799
obviously a

409
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,600
family that's had some kind of trouble

410
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,559
in the past

411
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,120
right so they're happy to welcome tom

412
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,679
back whoever this tom guy is

413
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,400
but the aunt it says she refused to

414
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,960
speak

415
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,159
or to speak to or look at him again she

416
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,480
she was upset with him from the past you

417
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,400
can come into my house but i'm not going

418
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,360
to talk to you

419
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,320
i'm not even gonna look at you i'm still

420
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,360
angry with you

421
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,080
i guess for something that tom did she

422
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,120
won't speak

423
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,120
or look at him that's right something

424
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,200
that tom did in the past was so

425
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,679
terrible that the ant won't speak to him

426
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:58,720
or look at him

427
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,960
again but of course martin this real

428
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,960
young man who's there is kind of like

429
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,159
okay i'm just happy you gave me food

430
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,640
it's actually this actually makes things

431
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,880
easier for martin you can kind of pull

432
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,480
this thing this thing

433
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,679
off he doesn't have to be seen by the

434
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,360
second person

435
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,000
anyways after his supper martin was led

436
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
to tom's room

437
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,080
and he had a good night's sleep the

438
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,120
first

439
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,400
in a very long time so he got his food

440
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,799
he got his rest and he's with this weird

441
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,600
family

442
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,080
maybe this is his fate this is where

443
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,080
he's going to end up

444
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,799
anyways folks that's it for today and

445
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,039

[Music]

447
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,480
you may often see cowboys as characters

448
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,400
in old western movies

449
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
the exciting fighting and shooting

450
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,159
scenes are regarded as an

451
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,960
essential part of american culture

452
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,919
besides

453
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,080
do you know that cowboys are important

454
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,720

also let's not forget the sheep goats

459
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,120
and horses that must be taken care of

460
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,600

466
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,360
with animals by doing so they begin to

467
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,960
understand the importance

468
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,000
of responsibility and hard work

469
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,279
