00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,040
so

00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:28,240
[Music]

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,000
hi everyone this is karen welcome

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,439
everybody i am shane

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,680
today we're looking at part one of a

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,520
walk on the high line

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,079
new york city's highest park and the

9
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,680
vocabulary words are

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,399
transport transport the company is

11
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,640
responsible for the transport of

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,920
building materials

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,440
from one place to another goods good

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,640
the goods in this store are extremely

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
expensive oh no abandoned

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,399
abandoned because of the typhoon many

17
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,760
people were forced

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,359
to abandon their homes exhibit exhibit

19
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,439
the museum has dozens of new exhibits

20
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,560
dense dense the treasure hunters cut

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,200
their way through the dense jungle

22
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,159
so we're talking about new york new york

23
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,280
a walk on the

24
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,880
high line yeah so i think a long long

25
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,640
time ago in the 1900s

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,720
new york it used to be like a really

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,280
dangerous place right in the early 1900s

28
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:27,680
right

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,920
that's right when they had to transport

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,280
like goods like

31
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,079
food and stuff through the city there

32
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,600
were a lot of accidents because there

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,840
were like carriages there's no cars yet

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,320
right

35
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,040
carriages and people and i guess there

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,880
were a lot of accidents so they needed

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,920
to think of a way

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,479
to get a train in through the city and

39
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:46,960
can

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,439
transport these goods safely that's

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,840
right so i think it was in the 1930s

42
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,079
that's when they built the high line

43
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,600
which is the elevated

44
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,479
railway so it's above everybody so it

45
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,040
doesn't

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,040
cause any problems so i think that

47
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,040
really helped you know new york with

48
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,640
their accidents

49
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,920
and um but as trucks became more popular

50
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,959
i think people started

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,440
abandoning the high line right so

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,120
basically they start figuring out other

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
ways of getting

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,920
goods through the city and of course

55
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,520
everything expanded and

56
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
modernized so they stopped using that

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,440
train line

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,360
so what do they use it for now but what

59
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,040
a pity though so i think you know back

60
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,520
in 2009 and new yorkers they're thinking

61
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,319
oh we gotta

62
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,760
turn into something else maybe a nice

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,160
park

64
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,480
nice park yeah that's a really

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,319
interesting idea

66
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,920
okay let's learn more about that and

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,599
we'll learn all about this park next

68
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,440
time all right enjoy enjoy

69
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
[Music]

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,879
a walk on the high line new york city's

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,319
highest park

72
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,239
the streets of new york city in the

73
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,200
early 1900s were a dirty and dangerous

74
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,080
place

75
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,480
steam-powered trains delivered food

76
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,120
alongside pedestrians and carriages

77
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,000
leading to many deadly accidents by the

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,720
1930s it was clear that something new

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,000
had to be done

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,720
enter the high line this elevated

81
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
railway solved a major problem for the

82
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,680
city

83
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
but over time it has changed to serve

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
the city in a much different way

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,239
hello everyone today's lesson is called

86
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,760
a walk on the high line

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,440
new york city's highest

88
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,480
park part one

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
hello everyone my name is jeff and my

90
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,959
name is mike

91
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,000
high park well yeah absolutely this

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,280
is not the kind of adjective we

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,920
often see when talking about a park we

94
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
might say the biggest park or the

95
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,280
greenest park or the oldest park or

96
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,000
something like

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
the most beautiful or the most beautiful

98
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
park but parks are generally made of

99
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,920
grass and trees

100
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,319
and gardens and lakes you know a good

101
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,040
park has

102
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,120
those things and these are things that

103
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,480
we find on the ground

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,000
grass trees gardens we don't find them

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,560
up in the air which is where we would

106
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,439
find something

107
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,478
we describe as being high so this is a

108
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,199
park

109
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,600
that is above the ground it is up in the

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,759
air it is over your head

111
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,479
this is kind of an unusual park i would

112
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,199
say

113
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,800
anyways it's located in new york city a

114
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,160
city with great parks

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
with great parks like central park but

116
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,360
we won't be talking about that

117
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,000
today anyways let's talk about new york

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,600
city a little bit

119
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,520
the streets of new york city

120
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,800
in the early 1900s were a

121
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,320
dirty and dangerous place

122
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,720
oh boy were they ever get this

123
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
steam powered trains

124
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,240
delivered food alongside

125
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,080
pedestrians and carriages

126
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
leading to many deadly

127
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,479
accident so we're not talking

128
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,919
oh here's a nice street and a curbing

129
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,280
and some sidewalks oh people were

130
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,680
walking and people were driving in cars

131
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,199
and they were separated

132
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,360
oh everybody was safe and nobody was

133
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,720
dying no no no we had

134
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,919
people in trains and carriages and there

135
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:34,560
were

136
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,479
no markings on the roads it was a mess

137
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,600
a deadly mess that's right deadly and

138
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,160
dirty because of course alongside those

139
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,560
steam-powered trains with their

140
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,280
smoke and steam you'd have horses and

141
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,680
carriages with all the horse poop on the

142
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,479
ground

143
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,880
it was not the place you wanted to be

144
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,080
walking around

145
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,039
in your brand new shoes that's for sure

146
00:05:59,039 --> 00:05:59,759
so

147
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,520
by the 1930s we read it was clear

148
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,479
that something new had to be done so

149
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,080
cars came in but the

150
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,720
trains were still there the roads were

151
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,919
not well organized

152
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
accidents happened people got hurt and

153
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,199
killed

154
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,639
so by the 1930s a few years later it was

155
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,680
clear that something new had to be done

156
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,520
this is something that everyone looked

157
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,960
around and said this is

158
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,000
crazy we have to do something to fix

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,960
these deadly dirty streets in new york

160
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,120
so what did they decide to do what did

161
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,600
they

162
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,080
decide to do that's what we're gonna

163
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,800
find out

164
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,319
next let's go ahead and move on

165
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,759
enter the high line

166
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,280
the high line high

167
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,479
line yes this elevated

168
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,680
railway solved a major problem for the

169
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
city

170
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,400
but over time it has changed

171
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,360
to serve the city in a much different

172
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,639
way so

173
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,240
before you had the train at the same

174
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,280
level as pedestrian on the ground

175
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,880
on the ground man big mistake

176
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,000
oh people were dying left and right

177
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,080
that's that's where the high line comes

178
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
in you take that train there

179
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
and you elevate it oh this is like you

180
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
can make it higher like the brown line

181
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,520
of the mrt

182
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,080
in taipei that goes down fushing road

183
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,479
right it's a train that runs above the

184
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,240
city left the street level

185
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,720
so the train stays out of people's way

186
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,919
that's why we call it

187
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,400
an elevated railway that is something

188
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,120
that is

189
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,960
higher well we'll find out more about

190
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,560
the high line and its

191
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,599
new form its new life in the city of new

192
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,240
york

193
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,120
after this break

194
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
up

195
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,000
um

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,880
a walk on the high line new york city's

197
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,320
highest park

198
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,800
cutting through new york's downtown area

199
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
the high line allowed for the transport

200
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,120
of goods to where they were needed

201
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,600
as trucks became more popular for making

202
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,560
deliveries

203
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
the high line was slowly abandoned

204
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
nature took its course

205
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,560
and while some sections of track were

206
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,600
torn down others gradually became home

207
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,959
to a wide variety of plants and animals

208
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,240
by 2009 new yorkers had realized the

209
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,240
value of this unique area

210
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
and the highline's new life as a public

211
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,850
park began

212
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,000
[Music]

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,600
okay cutting through new york's downtown

214
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,399
area

215
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,000
the high line allowed for the transport

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
of goods

217
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,240
to where they were needed so the trains

218
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,959
weren't running along the ground there

219
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,120
knocking pedestrians to the left and

220
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,040
right and killing people and stuff like

221
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,760
that

222
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,040
no no no this was now an elevated

223
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,720
train and it was high

224
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,640
off the ground it was now a high

225
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,240
line yes this elevation allowed for the

226
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,600
transport or movement

227
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,079
of goods to where they were needed and

228
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,839
here yes we do have the word

229
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,240
transport it's a noun transport is

230
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,800
movement you might have heard the word

231
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,920
transfer trade

232
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,560
transfer transportation excuse me

233
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,640
transportation is the movement of

234
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,519
one thing or some things i should say

235
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,000
from one

236
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
place to another transport is just

237
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,320
movement for example the company is

238
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,920
responsible for the

239
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,360
transport of building materials from one

240
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,240
place

241
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,000
to another they move building materials

242
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,720
from one place to another and here we're

243
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,680
talking about

244
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,519
the transport or the transportation of

245
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,920
goods that's right goods are things that

246
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,880
are sold

247
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
basically of course things that are made

248
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,240
in a factory

249
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,640
from pens and pencils to shoes

250
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,279
televisions and cars these are goods

251
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,800
they make them in the factory and then

252
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,279
they sell them in stores of all sorts of

253
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:11,839
types

254
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,760
but also we might talk about things that

255
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,040
come out of a farm

256
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,760
apples or grain or rice or things like

257
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,240
that

258
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,560
those could be goods as well so it could

259
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
be things that you find in your local

260
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,279
store

261
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,519
or things that big companies will buy in

262
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,000
large amounts like some company buys

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
millions of potatoes to make french

264
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,079
fries out of or something like that but

265
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,519
these are just things that are

266
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,040
sold in small sizes and large sizes

267
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,360
all over the place for example the goods

268
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,720
in this store

269
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,040
are extremely expensive maybe it's a

270
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,079
jewelry store

271
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,640
selling goods made of gold and silver

272
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,680
and stuff like that

273
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,000
all right let's get back to our our look

274
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,519
at the high line so

275
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,360
originally of course it was for the

276
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,519
transport of goods it says as

277
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,399
trucks became more popular for making

278
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,440
deliveries

279
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,720
the high line was slowly abandoned ah so

280
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:02,959
as

281
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:06,000
cars developed and small cars became

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,959
bigger trucks trucks became more useful

283
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,000
than trains they

284
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,639
can take large amounts in the big truck

285
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,000
but they can take it down

286
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,160
streets they can bring it right to your

287
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,320
door so moving things in

288
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,440
huge amounts like on a train was not so

289
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,000
useful

290
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,880
so this big train line through the city

291
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,920
was slowly

292
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,600
abandoned usually when you use this word

293
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,800
abandon you're saying

294
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,240
that you're going to leave something

295
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
somewhere and you're not going to come

296
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,279
back

297
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,160
and get it but here the idea is if

298
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,800
something

299
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,480
is abandoned it's no longer used or it's

300
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,360
being used

301
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,480
less and less and less for example

302
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,880
because of the typhoon many people were

303
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,519
forced

304
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,959
to abandon their homes they had to

305
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,000
leave their homes and they probably

306
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,760
weren't going to go back or they

307
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,240
wouldn't be able to go back now

308
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,440
nature it says took its course and

309
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,320
while some sections of track were torn

310
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,200
down

311
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,800
others gradually became home to a wide

312
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,839
variety of

313
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,279
plants and animals

314
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,880
starting to sound like the high line

315
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,000
is becoming a park well

316
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
slowly yes absolutely when nature takes

317
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,760
its course

318
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,160
that means nature does what it naturally

319
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,480
does if you abandon a home

320
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,880
after a year or two you'll find plants

321
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
growing in the corners and within five

322
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,399
years you might have birds

323
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,639
living inside the house because there

324
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,040
are no people there this is kind of

325
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,120
what happened with the high line plants

326
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,399
bushes flowers

327
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,040
birds move in squirrels are turning it

328
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,480
into their little home

329
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,560
it became a park it became kind of a

330
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,600
park nature

331
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,839
took it over again or came back and so

332
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,920
it says by 2009

333
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,839
so 40 50 67 years after the high line

334
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,399
was

335
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,120
slowly abandoned or just kind of left

336
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,160
alone by 2009 new yorkers had

337
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,680
realized the value of this unique area

338
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,760
what a cool place it's like a park

339
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,720
over our heads and the highline's new

340
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,120
life as a par public park

341
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,440
began i guess they could have torn it

342
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,839
down and turned it back into a road

343
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,560
there but

344
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,639
that costs a lot of money and you know

345
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,959
they don't need another road in new york

346
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:27,839
city but

347
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,720
a new park an interesting park a park

348
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
that has already begun

349
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,440
thanks to mother nature hmm there's an

350
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,880
interesting idea

351
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
there you go let's turn it let's turn it

352
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,880
into a public park

353
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,279
leave the high line alone all right

354
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,000
folks with that

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
it's time for us to take a break but

356
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,519
don't go away

357
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,360
we'll be back after this

358
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,839
channel

359
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,880
i think you should just relax and let

360
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,519
nature

361
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,480
take its course

362
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,440
they tore down the old house and built a

363
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,079
new one

364
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,240
australia is home to some of the most

365
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,560
dangerous animals in the world

366
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,160
a variety of

367
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,079
show there are a large variety of

368
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,679
vegetarian options

369
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,480
on the menu

370
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,000
how cool

371
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,960
a walk on the high line new york city's

372
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,400
highest park

373
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,799
currently the high line is almost a mile

374
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,919
and a half long

375
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,559
and features art exhibits food and gift

376
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,280
stands

377
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,840
performances and dense gardens that are

378
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,280
still growing

379
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,760
visitors can take in its natural beauty

380
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,080
while being surrounded by city sites and

381
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,970
views of the hudson river

382
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,840
[Music]

383
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,320

and now it is home to plants and animals

388
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,080
it's quite

389
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,440
the sight to see currently the high line

390
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,760
is

391
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,039

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,720
those

397
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,520
gardens from go from growing there you

398
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,919
go as you walk along the high line

399
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,320
this park above the streets of new york

400
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,200
you'll see art

401
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,440

402
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,760
performances lots of good stuff what is

403
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,720
an exhibit

404
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,200
an exhibit is basically a show that is

405
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,360
being put on for people to

406
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,039
see we're not talking about a

407
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,280
performance like dancers or

408
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,200
musicians we're talking about art

409
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,840
probably paintings sculptures

410
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,000
things like that especially if it's

411
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,160
there temporarily for just

412
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,480
a short time at the local museum they

413
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
might have an exhibit of picasso

414
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,440
paintings

415
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,360
there for a couple of months and anyone

416
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,520
who wants to see something cool and

417
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,000
interesting will go to the exhibit for

418
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,520
example the museum has

419
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,360
dozens of new exhibits picasso paintings

420
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,320
for example

421
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,880
for example anyways we also have this

422
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,360
word

423
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,160
dense to talk about let's say you have

424
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,240
an amount of something

425
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,720
okay if you were to somehow compress

426
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,440
that amount of something into a smaller

427
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,559
space

428
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,799
you would say that you now have a denser

429
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,120
material okay let's say you have

430
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,640
something that's light and fluffy

431
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,240
that's not dense something that is heavy

432
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,799
and small at the same time that would be

433
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,640
very dense so material like a metal like

434
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,280
gold let's say would be very dense

435
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,240
whereas

436
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,039
oh a pillow let's say you rest your head

437
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,640
on that's nice and soft

438
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,840
i wouldn't call that dense at all

439
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,720
for example the treasure hunters cut

440
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,600
their way

441
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,200
through the dense jungle there were

442
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,240
leaves and vines everywhere oh it's very

443
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,799
hard to

444
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,240
cut through they were just oh gosh just

445
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,360
plants everywhere was so dense in that

446
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,880
jungle there anyways visitors there if

447
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,480
you go to the high line

448
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,600
can take in its natural beauty while

449
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,000
being

450
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,039
surrounded by city sites and views

451
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,400
of the hudson river hmm on one of the

452
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,720
rivers that goes around the island of

453
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,799
manhattan so there you go the natural

454
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,240
beauty of the high line

455
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,720
stretches in front of you and off to one

456
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,000
side you can maybe

457
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,919
look out through the buildings or right

458
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,159

459
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:56,880

[Music]

472
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,320
aloha let me tell you a bit

473
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,360
about hula it's an important custom in

474
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,640
hawaii

475
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,520
it used to be a dance for social events

476
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,400
people performed it for enjoyment too

477
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,679
the songs or chants that go with hula

478
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,159
tell stories of native island people's

479
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,600
history

480
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,120
if i had to describe hula in one word

481
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,480
i would say that it's smooth

482
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,200
both the body movements and the chance

483
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,440
flow like water

484
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,320
many people don't realize that hula is

485
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,120
made up

486
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,320
of only six traditional moves

487
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,120
female hula dancers used to wear short

488
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,159
skirts

489
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,799
men wore clothes that covered only their

490
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,080
middle

491
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,960
when westerners arrived in hawaii in the

492
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
early 19th century

493
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,600
they wanted hula dancers to cover their

494
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,880
bodies

495
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,400
so both men and women hula dancers

496
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,760
began wearing longer skirts hula

497
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,159
is protected by the hawaiian goddess

498
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:45,279
laka

499
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,919
people believe lakka causes the dancers

500
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:48,720
movements

501
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,159
