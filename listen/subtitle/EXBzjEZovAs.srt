00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,079
part two of

8
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,399
tom holland from ballet to spider-man

9
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,160
and beyond and the vocabulary words are

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,200
backgrounds background the company

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,520
hasn't hired susan yet because they want

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,840
to know more about her background

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,199
be fine define travis feels that his job

14
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,559
does not define who he is as a person

15
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,359
career career i think a career in

16
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,079
science

17
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,438
best suits you adventure adventure

18
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,000
brett told me about an adventure novel

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,920
that he is reading

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,960
charity charity my brother works for a

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,040
charity that provides food and clothing

22
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,720
for the homeless

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,240
so we're still talking about this

24
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,200
talented actor and dancer tom holland

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
choo choo choo choo spider-man right did

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,400
you know that in fact he performs his

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,680
own stunts in spider-man you are joking

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
usually they have a stunt man right

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,600
that's right especially if you're a big

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,280
actor or something like that

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,799
because it could be a little dangerous

32
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,799
right or perhaps you don't have the

33
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:39,600
skills

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
to do some of the movements that you

35
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,920
need to do but because of his dancing

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,960
background

37
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,600
he's actually really good at doing flips

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,840
and everything you see him doing

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,240
that's not a stuntman that's him that's

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
pretty awesome and i think he doesn't

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,200
want to

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,320
just have spider-man define his career

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,320
so he's actually trying out different

44
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,920
kind of roles like you know crimes

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,119
adventures

46
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,439
or there's also like different many many

47
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,920
different even sci-fi too wow

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,758
yeah well it doesn't just stop there

49
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,440
because he also helps the

50
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,920
community right so they have something

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,520
called the brothers trust

52
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,360
that's right and what that does is help

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,640
get money for

54
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,879
some charities that don't get a lot of

55
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,239
public attention

56
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,879
wow so of course you know if the

57
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,800
charity's not in the spotlight maybe

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,319
people aren't going to be giving money

59
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,360
so he tries to

60
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,640
get money to those important but not so

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,239
well-known charities

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,239

87
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,040
young

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,519
he continues to be young but he won't be

89
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,760
young forever but he did start

90
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,080
very young as a young dancer and then he

91
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,200
learned ballet

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,840
for two years he started as billy

93
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
elliott in the west end sort of broadway

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
here in london doing

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,560
the musical billy elliot but of course

96
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,280
it was his

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,920
star turn his big chance his big

98
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
opportunity as

99
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,080
peter parker or or spider-man but he's

100
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,959

101
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,760
he's not gonna be spider-man forever no

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,560
he's got a six-picture deal after that

103
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,599
he'll probably

104
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,640
move on and do something else cool or

105
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,160
retire because he'll have

106
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,600
tons of money anyways though let's get

107
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,079
started with today's lesson

108
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,199
today everyone knows

109
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,280
holland as peter parker the

110
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,080
teenager who fights evil

111
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,000
alongside other marvel heroes like

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,880
iron man and thor on the

113
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,120
avengers now thanks to his

114
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,840
dance background he's able to perform

115
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,880
all of his own stunts

116
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,000
in the films by the way here

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,400
when we're using the word background

118
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,320
we're talking about someone's

119
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,000
history or experience with something for

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,960
example

121
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,720
the company hasn't hired susan yet

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,759
because they want to know more about her

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:10,720
background

124
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,440
yeah your resume is kind of incomplete

125
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,479
we need to know

126
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,479
more about your past of course now yes

127
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,600
when you've seen the

128
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,720
avengers movies the spider-man movies as

129
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,080
you said spider-man

130
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,720
doesn't dance very much but with an

131
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,759
experience

132
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,320
in dance with a background in dance he's

133
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,800
very

134
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,000
physically capable he can do things with

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,320
his

136
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,360
body that other people non-dancers

137
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
might have more trouble with and of

138
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,759
course they've used these skills

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
as spider-man so when you see spider-man

140
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,919
do a backflip in the movies that's

141
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,360
really holland

142
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,720
showing off his own amazing abilities so

143
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,759
if it was someone

144
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,919
without a dance background they might

145
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,840
have to get a stunt person

146
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,639
to do these tricks i know i would right

147
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,039
i don't

148
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,800
do a backflip you don't have a dance

149
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,479
background they might have to use

150
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,880
cgi and things like that now of course

151
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,800
when he's climbing up the side of a

152
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,600
building

153
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
that's probably some computers at work

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,639
there

155
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,639
but when he's jumping around when he's

156
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,199
doing some amazing things on his own two

157
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:17,840
feet

158
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,560
that really is tom holland under that

159
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,199
mask

160
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,000
and not a stunt person because of these

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,520
amazing abilities

162
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,600
and his dance background where we're

163
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
gonna dance off to a quick break

164
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,560
and then we'll tap our way back for part

165
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,759
the next part of the

166
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,080
article

167
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,840
is

168
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,840
foreign

169
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,360
tom holland from ballet to spider-man

170
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,479
and beyond although spider-man is a huge

171
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,120
role

172
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,879
holland doesn't want to let it define

173
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,400
his whole career

174
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,160
that's why in addition to another

175
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,440
spider-man film

176
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,840
holland has crime adventure and even

177
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,560
science fiction films all coming up

178
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,319
he hopes that all this work will help

179
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,199
him move on to a role as a director

180
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,520
in fact he already has some film ideas

181
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,160
in the works

182
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,199
okay tom holland he's spider-man

183
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,560
and that's that he's known

184
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,280
worldwide for being spider-man

185
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,880
but although spider-man is

186
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,640
a huge role holland

187
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,080
doesn't want to let it define

188
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,720
his whole career he wants to have a life

189
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,320
outside of acting maybe and being

190
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,839
spider-man maybe he wants to go back to

191
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:52,560
being a

192
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,240
carpenter one day after he leaves acting

193
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,120
ah okay well that's a good idea for an

194
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,519
actor you don't want to be defined as

195
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,120
one type of actor

196
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,080
or limited to one style of movie when we

197
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,720
define

198
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
things well we could use this to say we

199
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,959
describe them we kind of

200
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,519
give you an idea of what they are we

201
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,399
draw a picture using words to give you

202
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,880
you know a more of a clear idea of

203
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,560
something of what something is

204
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,880
but we also use it to kind of say we put

205
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,560
things in a category

206
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,680
or we put things in a box when actors

207
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,480
are defined by a certain type of movie

208
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,600
we might say oh the rock he does action

209
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,240
movies where he uses his big muscles and

210
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,000
that's who you are that's that that's

211
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,560
who you are we put you in that category

212
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,880
let's talk about this uh word defined by

213
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,040
looking at the example sentence

214
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,920
travis feels that his job does not

215
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,959
define

216
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,839
who he is as a person yeah he's a

217
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,440
computer engineer

218
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,120
people might think that he's a little

219
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
boring and he's always tapping away on

220
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,399
his computer

221
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,040
but he actually likes to play jazz music

222
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,480
on the weekends and he's an

223
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,600
artist too so he's not defined by his

224
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,079
job

225
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,640
that's what i do for a living it's not

226
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,320
me that's my career

227
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,959
my whole personality but it's not who i

228
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,360
am

229
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,240
down deep it doesn't define me now

230
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,279
speaking of the word career

231
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,720
the word career refers

232
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,240
to your job but more specifically your

233
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,120
career

234
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,480
is something that you often train

235
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,399
for to do for your entire

236
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,920
life to make money to support yourself

237
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,120
so on so forth for example

238
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,640
i think a career in science

239
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,000
best suits you yeah you should be

240
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,440
a researcher or something like

241
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,120
that anyways tom holland he doesn't want

242
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,800
spider-man to define him and that's why

243
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,680
in addition to another spider-man film

244
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,040
holland has crime

245
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,160
adventure and even

246
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,200
science fiction films

247
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,720
all coming up get ready folks

248
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,640
he is going to be everywhere

249
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,800
his mug is going to be plastered

250
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,440
everywhere his face on a lot of movie

251
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,320
posters

252
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,959
all right so yes he does have another

253
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,200
superhero film coming up another

254
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,760
spider-man film but as you can see he

255
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,000
doesn't want to be defined as just a

256
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
superhero

257
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,680
action movie actor he's going to do a

258
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,800
crime film

259
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,040
an adventure film and some science

260
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,839
fiction not

261
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,639
spider-man and space something totally

262
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,720
different when we talk about adventure

263
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,680
we talk about an exciting experience if

264
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,160
you go

265
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,639
canoeing through the amazon that would

266
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,320
be an adventure that would be an

267
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,959
exciting experience and so an adventure

268
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:03,600
film

269
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,079
would kind of be like an action film

270
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,079
there'll be some danger there'll be some

271
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,600
exciting scenes

272
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,959
fist fights car chases things like that

273
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,040
it won't leave you sitting in your chair

274
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,320
falling asleep after

275
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,880
20 minutes it will have a lot of action

276
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,680
excitement

277
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,639
and adventure for example brett told me

278
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:23,200
about an

279
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,720
adventure novel that he is reading so

280
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
tom holland has a lot of different

281
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,279

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,839
him

285
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,040
move on to a role as a director

286
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,079
how ambitious interesting he wants to

287
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,200
move from being an

288
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,560
actor to a director

289
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,160

for someone who's only 24 years old

311
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,040
popular culture

do as a family

331
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,440
i like how he hasn't even put his name

332
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,120
on it but tom holland foundation

333
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,920
that would sound audacious and kind of

334
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,360
pretentious no

335
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,040

336
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,839

needy one thing

343
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,839
usually charities are non-profit

344
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,039
they're not in it for the dollar or to

345
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,079
make money for example my

346
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,880
brother works for a charity that

347
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,839
provides

348
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,599
food and clothing for the homeless

349
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,480
so there you go that's wonderful that

350
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,760
sounds like a really good

351
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,160
charity what about the brothers trust

352
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,000
the tom holland or the holland

353
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,280
family charity it says the organization

354
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,520
or

355
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,080
the charity the brothers trust the

356
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,039
organization

357
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,000
raises money for charities that don't

358
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,640
get

359
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,840
a lot of public attention oh interesting

360
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,280
so he can kind of

361
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,400
move from idea to you know issue to

362
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,799
you know good cause that he thinks

363
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,640
really needs a bit of attention there

364
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,720
are a lot of charities out there

365
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,640
a lot of us know some of the well-known

366
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,559
ones greenpeace or

367
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,360
amnesty international but there are many

368
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,520
that don't get a lot of public

369
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
attention maybe they're helping people

370
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,039
in a smaller less

371
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,440
noticed part of the world or an issue

372
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,080
that only

373
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,559
a few people have problems with but they

374
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,760
still need help

375
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,840
they still need attention and tom

376
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
holland being a big star

377
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,559
can bring some attention and some money

378
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,200
to these

379
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,760
charities that's a great idea let's

380
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,520

which one would you like to see

406
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,200
hmm well i actually haven't looked at a

407
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,360
list of many of his movies but

408
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,080
i'd say my favorite movie is

409
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,320
avengers civil note

410
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,840
captain america civil war i think he was

411
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,120
in that one there was a

412
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,440
spider say say spider-man homecoming

413
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,480
spider-man hope

414
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,039
i didn't see that one anyways one of the

415
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,200
marvel movies i thought was pretty good

416
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,000
in that movie

417
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,480
tom holland played spider-man he was

418
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,280
kind of young

419
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,240
he was kind of enthusiastic you know

420
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,679
iron man was kind of

421
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,640
acting his his mentor it was very good

422
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,280
and i thought

423
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,600
tom howland was entertaining but i would

424
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,080
also be interested to see him in a crime

425
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,240
film or that science fiction film pretty

426
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,799
much

427
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,880
anything where he's not spider-man

428
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,400
because yeah i think he is

429
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,799
a young talented guy and i just like to

430
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,760
see him in

431
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,159
something different so i will definitely

432
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:33,760
be paying attention

433
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,080
to what's coming up could tom holland be

434
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,520
a bad guy

435
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,080
hmm good question or maybe could he be

436
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,200
james bond in

437
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,799
10 20 years possibly who knows

438
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,360
anyways folks with that our lesson is

439
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,159
now in the

440
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,400

443
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,840
the brothers trust

444
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,880
her passion for teaching left its mark

445
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,840
on her students

446
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
on

447
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,900
[Music]

448
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,160
foreign

449
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,559
[Music]

450
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,679
is there anybody out there

451
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,919
that is a question many people have

452
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,400
thought about for a long time

453
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
scientists have been using radio

454
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
telescopes to listen for

455
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,360
signals from space in the past

456
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,440
people have also sent messages to the

457
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,720
stars

458
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,520
nasa sent out radio waves of popular

459
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,080
music

460
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,360
and old tv shows they hoped that

461
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,080
aliens would receive the messages and

462
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,559
establish contact with earth

463
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,279
however not everyone thinks it's a good

464
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:57,919
idea

465
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,880
to search for life on other planets what

466
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,039
if the aliens are dangerous

467
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,200
maybe they will attack us if they find

468
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,120
out earth's location

469
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,520
still some people believe contacting

470
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,159
aliens

471
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,799
is a good idea it would be nice to know

472
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:13,679
if humans are

473
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,640
alone in the universe or not what do you

474
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,360
think

475
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,640
should we continue to look for aliens or

476
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,279
is it better to remain silent so that no

477
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,760
one can find us

478
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,200
here is more information

479
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,559

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,880
the child but the police stopped him

481

the astronomer found a new planet

484
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,240
claim she claims she saw an

485
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,720
alien but i don't believe her

486
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,640
detect the dog detected the earthquake

487
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,760
before it happened

488
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,440
infected clean that cut or

489
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,799
it will get infected

490
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,240
participate eight people

491
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,840
participated in the game

492
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,039
quarantine tina was quarantined

493
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,840

494
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,760
sighting there was a bear sighting this

495
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,480
morning

496
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,799
so be careful on your hike

497
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,159
support ian works hard to

498
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,440
support his family

499
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,840
so what did you think of today's lesson

500
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
