00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,240
hi everyone this is Karen welcome back

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,870

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,940
this is Shannon today we're looking at

5
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,150
part two of Miguel good for the body

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,150
good for the earth and the vocabulary

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,840
words are popularity popularity because

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,059
of the restaurants popularity

9
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:40,170
you should call ahead to book a table

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,230
weekend weekend the floods weakened the

11
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:47,530
structure of the building hmm retain

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:52,409
retained this pan retains heat very well

13
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:55,659
sensitive sensitive I have sensitive

14
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:59,440
teeth so I try not to eat cold food oh

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,549
no ice cream for me for you pollution

16
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:06,370
pollution big cities often have high

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:09,970
levels of air pollution hmm so we're

18
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,430
still talking about this yummy yummy

19
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,240
Miguel right yes so I don't really know

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,830
much about it because I've never tried

21
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:21,640
it but so far I've heard that it's tasty

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,370
that's right me according to your oh

23
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,840
that's right it's good for the body

24
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,670
mm-hmm so today we'll talk about how

25
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,800
it's good for the earth for the earth

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,230
that's right okay because in will lie I

27
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,030
think a lot of farmers they try to grow

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,670
different kind of crops and growing the

29
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,040
other kind of crops like rise vegetable

30
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,860
these kind of crops was weaken the soil

31
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,350
and you would have to use some

32
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,390
fertilizer which is not really good for

33
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,220
the environment it requires a lot of

34
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,580
water that's that kind of resource but

35
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,370
Miguel the way that the plant grows the

36
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,770
roots are quite deep that's right so

37
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,070
it's quite stable for the soil and when

38
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,390
they pick the macaw

39
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,820
it doesn't really they're not to pull

40
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,980
out the roots the roots stay in there so

41
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,769
it's very easy to maintain

42
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:11,200
exactly and you don't have to you don't

43
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,180
need a lot of water yeah and you don't

44
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,310
need a fertilizer so no chemical is

45
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,890
needed which is really good for our

46
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,470
environment yeah because there's a lot

47
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:22,700
of pollution when we are

48
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,830
when we have crops right growing crops

49
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,980
so if we can have a crop that is good

50
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,640
for us and good for the earth I think

51
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,730
people like me should really try it yeah

52
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:38,150
exactly occasionally all right so let's

53
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:45,530
learn more about gal Maga good for the

54
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,510
body good for the earth

55
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,910
the popularity of Maga is good news for

56
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,190
both local farmers and the environment

57
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,010
in the past farmers in all I cleared

58
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,049
forest land to grow crops which

59
00:02:57,049 --> 00:02:58,880
consisted of rice and vegetables

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,640
initially and persimmon mushroom and

61
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,610
bamboo shoots later on the problem with

62
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,290
some of these crops is that they either

63
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,930
weaken the soil when harvested or need

64
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:12,370
lots of pesticides or fertilizers

65
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,680
[Music]

66
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,500
today's lesson is called Macau good for

67
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,190
the body good for the earth part 2 hi

68
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,680
everyone my name is Jeff and I might

69
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,230
guess McGaw of the mountain pepper a

70
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,560
local fruit grown up in Li the

71
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,750
@il people have known about its

72
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,389
wonderful health benefits and its great

73
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:38,420
taste in food for a very long time but

74
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,430
only now is the rest of the world

75
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,590
catching up we've learned that it can be

76
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,560
used in food you can eat it fresh and

77
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,049
maybe a salad make it into tea turn it

78
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:50,150
into medicine it can be good for that

79
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,420
digestive system all sorts of wonderful

80
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,299
benefits of this plant the mug ow yes

81
00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:00,139
and it's fruit Macau is catching on big

82
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,569
time and this is good news yeah the

83
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,660
popularity of Macau is good news for

84
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:09,200
both local farmers and the environment

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,569
so yes because Macau is now popular

86
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:14,180
local farmers people who are growing

87
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,608
them a Gao they're gonna sell more make

88
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:19,579
more money but Macau is also apparently

89
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,340
good for the environment mmm absolutely

90
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,289
yeah when we talk about how popular

91
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:27,130
something is we can use the noun

92
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,910
popularity all right we're just

93
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,010
basically saying how well-known how

94
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,960
famous how much your average person

95
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,110
knows about this as trends and styles

96
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:36,800
and

97
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,110
fashions come and go their popularity

98
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,960
goes up and it goes down depending on

99
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,300
the year and what's going on for example

100
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,699
because of the restaurants popularity

101
00:04:46,699 --> 00:04:49,879
you should call ahead to book a table

102
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,159
the restaurants popularity tells us it's

103
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,190
popular so it's very busy maybe five

104
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,110
years from now the popularity will have

105
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,599
gone down but right now it's hot hot hot

106
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,090
everyone wants to go there it is very

107
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,520
popular it has lots of popularity you

108
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,440
might even be famous it could be yeah

109
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,800
anyways moving on in the past farmers in

110
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,550
a lie

111
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,180
cleared forest land to grow crops which

112
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,969
consisted of rice and vegetables

113
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:20,060
initially and persimmon mushroom and

114
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,210
bamboo shoots later on and yes when you

115
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,599
clear a forest land that's not really

116
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:29,719
ever a good thing you shouldn't cut down

117
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:32,930
forests or clear forest land and you

118
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,699
have a problem with some of these other

119
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,580
crops that we're just talking about a

120
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,039
problem with some of these crops is that

121
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,259
they either weaken the soil when

122
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:46,250
harvested or need lots of pesticides or

123
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,849
fertilizers so not only are you clearing

124
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,110
forest land

125
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:54,500
you're also weakening the soil and using

126
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,779
a lot of chemicals chemical pesticides

127
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:58,969
and fertilizers and stuff like that so

128
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:02,090
none of these things are good for the

129
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,159
environment ok before we take a break

130
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:07,759
let's talk about the verb weakened ok

131
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,099
the verb weakened is the opposite of the

132
00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:12,949
verb strengthened if you make something

133
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:16,789
strong or stronger you strengthen that

134
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:17,210
thing

135
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,069
now when you weaken something you do the

136
00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:21,560
opposite you make it weaker than it was

137
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,080
before so maybe before you are very

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,440
strong ok and then you stop working out

139
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,699
or you got sick or something

140
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:31,310
oh you're not as strong anymore that

141
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,319
means you have been weakened

142
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:35,569
for example the floods weakened the

143
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,969
structure of the building before it was

144
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:39,889
a strong building but then the floods

145
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:43,190
showed up the whole area flooded and yes

146
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,560
the building's structure weakened it

147
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,199
might even fall down Oh No all right

148
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,729
folks at that it's time for us to take a

149
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:50,520
short break but

150
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,759
go away we'll be back after this hello

for the earth on the other hand

182
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,830
Macau has deep roots which make the

183
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,560
shrub an effective soil stabilizer it's

184
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,870
also easy to plant and the plant retains

185
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,309
its structure when it's fruit is

186
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:35,070
harvested but perhaps most importantly

187
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,828
it requires less water and no chemicals

188
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:41,039
to help it grow in fact using chemicals

189
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,899
on this sensitive plant would likely

190
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,979
damage or kill it

191
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,200
so once upon a time farmers in wool I

192
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,330
they cleared a bunch of forest land

193
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,460
which is not good and then they started

194
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,120
planting stuff plants crops that were

195
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,490
one bad for the soil that would weaken

196
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:03,830
the soil and then two they would plant

197
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,560
these crops that would also require the

198
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,080
use of fertilizers and stuff like that

199
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,330
chemical pesticides you name them and

200
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,090
these aren't good things and apparently

201
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,100
though Mugello is good for the

202
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
environment it's going to solve these

203
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,760
problems well hopefully I mean it is a

204
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,890
problem in Taiwan where a lot of the

205
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:24,470
land is on hillsides and during the

206
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,660
heavy rains that come with our typhoons

207
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,150
which are a part of life that can make

208
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,430
the whole side of the hill slide off

209
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,220
farms can be destroyed it can be really

210
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,380
really destructive and you know people

211
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,070
need to eat

212
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,900
but some of these foods that they're

213
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,970
growing up on those hillsides are not

214
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:43,430
the best thing on the other hand we read

215
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:47,000
Macau has deep roots which make the

216
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,570
shrub an effective soil stabilizer those

217
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,550
deep roots basically help to sort of

218
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,700
glue or stick or hold the soil in place

219
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,910
so if the rains come a lot of the soil

220
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,860
will not get washed the roof

221
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,870
strengthened the soil that's exactly

222
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,610
right gather in a living place you get

223
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,700
this it's also easy to plant and the

224
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,030
plant retains its structure when it's

225
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,000
fruit is harvested so there you go it's

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,520
easy to plant and also you won't have to

227
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,470
tear the entire shrub out of the ground

228
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,780
tear those roots out - no no no it will

229
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,660
retain its structure when you harvest it

230
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,460
that's very cool kind of like just if

231
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,890
you pick an apple off a tree the apple

232
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,110
tree just stays perfectly the same it's

233
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,030
not changed it's not like pulling the

234
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,430
whole rice plant out of the ground like

235
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:36,890
with other things retain to retain

236
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,260
something this verb means to keep it to

237
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,060
hold it it's something that you have

238
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,280
something might be trying to take it

239
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,710
away from you but you're holding on to

240
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,690
it okay one simple thing we try to

241
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,330
retain when we're cold is heat if you

242
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,520
wear a jacket if you put on a hat and

243
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,100
cover your hands or your ears one on a

244
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,410
very cold day it will keep your body

245
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:00,590
warmer those things especially a hat on

246
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,080
head and gloves on your hands will help

247
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,390
you retain or keep that heat in your

248
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,600
body keeping you feeling warm all right

249
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,670
we do actually use this word a lot now

250
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,530
talking about heat and cold or things

251
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,160
like that

252
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,050
here's another example from the world of

253
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,710
cooking this pan retains heat very well

254
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:21,110
so you warm it up and then it keeps the

255
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,390
heat so it will cook your food in a very

256
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,030
even regular way stays hot for a long

257
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,610
time days hot that's no more Miguel

258
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:31,900
though but perhaps most importantly it

259
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,500
requires less water and no chemicals to

260
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,930
help it grow somewhat Gao it sounds

261
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:41,780
really good to me if you plant Macao you

262
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,270
will strengthen the soil and get this

263
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:47,240
you can't use chemicals either when

264
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,890
growing it so you wouldn't have to use

265
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:51,110
pesticides or fertilizers or anything

266
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,080
else like that in fact using chemicals

267
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,960
like this on this sensitive plant would

268
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,110
like the damage or kill it so there you

269
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,600
go we're undoing all the damage that

270
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,360
conventional crops can do here in Taiwan

271
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,340
we're not weakening soil and we're also

272
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,470
not using it chemicals

273
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,780
sounds good to me now before we take our

274
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,460
break let's go ahead and take a look at

275
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,610
the adjectives sensitive if something is

276
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,760
sensitive it is easily affected by other

277
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,060
things like sensitive people react very

278
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,150
strongly to insults and stuff like that

279
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,760
in fact they might perceive things that

280
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,370
other people don't perceive now what

281
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,620
we're saying here is that the McGowen is

282
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,410
very sensitive so you can't add

283
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,850
chemicals and you've got to be careful

284
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,860
with it because you can hurt it you can

285
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,870
hurt it easily I should say or it will

286
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,270
be easily affected by things the things

287
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,070
that you do to it so be careful for

288
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,610
example I have sensitive teeth so I try

289
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,580
not to eat cold foods yes if I eat ice

290
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,550
cream oh it really affects me I can feel

291
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:58,010
that cold because I've got sensitive

292
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:00,110
teeth all right everyone with that it's

293
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,850
time for us to take a break but don't go

294
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,120
away we'll be right back after this all

295
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,040

Macao good for the body good for the

earth

323
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,779
Macau is therefore an ideal crop because

324
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:23,000
it is highly adaptable to eco-friendly

325
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,699
farming methods it helps keep pollution

326
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,800
out of the waters and it plays a role in

327
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,050
maintaining a balance in the ecosystem

328
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:32,720
in addition since the demand for Miguel

329
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,269
for medicine and cooking and as a source

330
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,970
of essential oil is there farmers can

331
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,199
make a profit from it

332
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,779
Macau is indeed one powerful plant

333
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,670
Mike I think I'm gonna do it are you I

334
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,960
think that I'm gonna move out of the

335
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,240
country okay and open I'm a gal

336
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,910
plantation that would be great

337
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,370
what do you know about farming I don't

338
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,080
know anything about farming but I know

339
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,540
that Macau if I were to plant it then I

340
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,490
would be doing the right thing as far as

341
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,350
the environment is concerned well you

342
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:07,420
have a point there I would suggest you

343
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,520
know watching a youtube video about

344
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,040
farming or something before you do it

345
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,290
but that is a very good point and that

346
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,480
is also what we have in our next

347
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,660
sentence Macau is therefore an ideal

348
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,870
crop it's a perfect crop because it is

349
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,320
highly adaptable to eco-friendly farming

350
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,900
methods so this is a good product for

351
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,970
farmers even beginner farmers like our

352
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,460
friend here and it's also really good

353
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,470
for the environment so it's one of those

354
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,960
things that a farmer can grow and not

355
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,360
really worry about the bad effects of

356
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,760
the chemical or damaging the soil the

357
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,190
chemicals these damaging the soil it

358
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:47,590
doesn't have any of those problems there

359
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,750
you go it helps keep pollution out of

360
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,880
the waters and it plays a role in

361
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:55,210
maintaining a balance in the ecosystem

362
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,520
so there you go once I catch on and like

363
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,030
Macau plantation becomes prosperous and

364
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,060
fruitful not only will I have tons of

365
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,490
cash for selling all this Macau but I'll

366
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,460
also be helping out the environment okay

367
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,560
remember it says here Miguel plays a

368
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,440
role in maintaining a balance in the

369
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,470
ecosystem don't forget it also keeps a

370
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,840
pollution out of the waters and that

371
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,700
would be a good thing because pollution

372
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:24,250
is a bad thing pollution this noun is

373
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,840
dirt and poison and junk and stuff we

374
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,210
don't want in the environment it's the

375
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,490
smoke in the air it's the chemicals in

376
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,950
the river it's the chemicals on the dirt

377
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,200
on the ground and the in the soil it's

378
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,020
garbage piles outside all the big cities

379
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,240
we can also talk about other things like

380
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,940
noise pollution all those loud trucks

381
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,490
and sounds you luciene light pollution

382
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:51,070
why can't I see the stars when I'm in

383
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:53,650
the city light pollution so these are

384
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,990
sort of negative things produced by

385
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,420
people or what people do

386
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,639
and it's in the environment it has a an

387
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,040
effect on our lives we try to reduce

388
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,949
pollution but pollution is a part of

389
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:08,230
life but there are things we can do to

390
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,959
make it better for example big cities

391
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,949
big cities often have high levels of air

392
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,309
pollution cars trucks factories putting

393
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:20,230
stuff into the air that chemicals those

394
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:22,510
chemicals that's the pollution as as

395
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,880
developing countries very often as those

396
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,679
countries are modernizing and building

397
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,140
factories sometimes they produce a lot

398
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,110
of pollution especially air pollution

399
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,540
anyways back to Macau and how it's going

400
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,720
to save the day in addition since the

401
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,669
demand for Macau for medicine and

402
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:42,549
cooking and as a source of essential oil

403
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:45,760
is there farmers can make a profit from

404
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,410
it so not only will it be good for the

405
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,480
environment but the farmers who make it

406
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,570
can make a profit so again once I open

407
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,580
my plantation and get it up and running

408
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,730
maybe I can make some money but no I

409
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,250
won't do this all-out local farmers to

410
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,710
make the Mogao and to make the profit as

411
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,620
well anyways this much is for certain

412
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,460
Macau is indeed one powerful plant it's

413
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,910

415
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,110
