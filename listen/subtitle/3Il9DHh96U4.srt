popularity

19
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,960
popularity the popularity of the tv show

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,040
turned its sleet actress into a big star

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,000
ingredient ingredient the cooks at this

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,600
restaurant prefer to use

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,320
local ingredients so we're still talking

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,080
about the amazing

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,799
miracle crop soybeans right yeah it's

26
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,360
just

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
very very healthful it's like loaded

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,479
with protein

29
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,000
and minerals and vitamins and it's

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,119
even connected or linked to

31
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,840
lower heart disease that's right and

32
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,400
less

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
less people getting cancer i think

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,960
that's probably because

35
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,560
meat is usually connected to heart

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,079
disease and cancer

37
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,119
and type 2 diabetes so if you're eating

38
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:44,880
a more healthful diet with soybeans

39
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,079

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,799

mike yes we're talking about the amazing

87
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
things that the humble little soybean

88
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,879
can do for us from making soy sauce to

89
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,280
making a fake type of coffee that i

90
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,280
don't think people drink much anymore

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,319
but they did

92
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,319
in the past and then scientists

93
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,560
discovered that it had a lot of protein

94
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,120
you could use it to make oil you could

95
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
turn it into plastic to make

96
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,159
cars with apparently and of course it

97
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,439
also became a very

98
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,319
cheap but healthy animal feed or animal

99
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:08,879
food

100
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,200
that they gave to lots of farm animals

101
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,599
so people have been using soy in

102
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,959
lots of amazing ways for a very long

103
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,160
time tofu is made

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,199
from soy it's another one delicious it's

105
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,880
wonderful it's great i love eating

106
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,479

soy and soy products to animals

108
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,720

109
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800

are recognizing the benefits of eating

112
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,080
soy and soy products making it a

113
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,440
popular health food product it says

114
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,280
soybeans are loaded with

115
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,400
protein fiber vitamins

116
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,440

117
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,000

much everything you might need protein

120
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,759
that we might get from meat

121
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,840
fiber that we might get from you know

122
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,680
wheat or grains or

123
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
certain fruit vitamins of course from

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,280
fruit and vegetables

125
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,039
and minerals from lots of different

126
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,039
things but all of those things

127
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,520
are in soy and also we see in this

128
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
sentence not in small amounts

129
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,400
in large amounts right soybeans are

130
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,280
loaded

131
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,240
with these things yes there are large

132
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,919
amounts of these things

133
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,759
packed in soybeans that's what the word

134
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,520
loaded means found in large quantities

135
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,000
packed with so on and so forth so what

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,360
we're saying here

137
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,000
is that soybeans are really good for you

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,400
if you

139
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,280
eat them you will get large amounts of

140
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,000
these good

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,520
things like protein fiber vitamins

142
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,880
minerals etc for example

143
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,160
these snacks are loaded with sugar you

144
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,639
shouldn't

145
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,319
eat those they've got way too much

146
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,759
sugar in them anyways moreover

147
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,520
consuming soy can improve

148
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,960
bone health and may even be linked

149
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,960
to lower risks of heart disease

150
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,479
certain forms of cancer and

151
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,240
type 2 diabetes

152
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,360
wow so start eating

153
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,120
soy everyone absolutely it does sound

154
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,000
like one of those

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,880
super foods we often hear about so when

156
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,199
we use this adverb moreover

157
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,120
it's something you might use especially

158
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
in your writing to show that the

159
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,240
sentence before

160
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,400
and this sentence that i'm using

161
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,360
moreover

162
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,400
to begin they're connected it's all kind

163
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
of the same idea

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,800
basically we use moreover this adverb in

165
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,639
the same way that we would use

166
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,400
other words like also in addition

167
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,840
furthermore and you know things like

168
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,960
that we're basically

169
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,520
connecting things it's all one big group

170
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,880
of information

171
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,919
it all is very closely related but we're

172
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,560
just separating it into two sentences

173
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,039
but the second one moreover shows that

174
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,240
there's a connection

175
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
between the first and this one for

176
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,440
example randy's grades have been down

177
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,639
this semester

178
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,520
so he's not doing well at school right

179
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,560
moreover

180
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,000
he often shows up late to class another

181
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
thing that shows

182
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,080
he's having trouble at school anyways

183
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,240
folks with that it's time for us to

184
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,919
take a break and to eat some soy

185
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,840
we'll be back right after this yum yum

186
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,840
hello daddy

187
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839

189
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,200
comes in many forms

190
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,040
it's easy to fit this food into your

191
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,480
diet

192
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,800

people

261
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,560
rarely use this word these days

262
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,680
usually people just use the word

263
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,600

you don't really eat healthy food let's

266
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,160
say you have an apple

267
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,800
and the apple is growing on the tree and

268
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,200
it's

269
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,360
thriving you can say that that apple

270
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,480
is healthy and let's say you

271
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,360

eat it and it makes you healthy

276
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,240
that apple has been healthful

277
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,240
for you so here the word healthful means

278
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,279
healthy but it does mean

279
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,480

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,520
a factor

385
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,760
and choosing legumes such as soy over

386
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,039
meat for our meals

387
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,880
could reduce greenhouse gases and

388
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,360
conserve water and land use

389
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,840
soybeans are healthful simple to grow

390
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,159
and less harmful to the environment

391
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,720
it's fair to say that soybeans truly are

392
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,150
a miracle crop

393
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,080
[Music]

394
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,240
mike yes we've left something out while

395
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,440
while talking about this miracle

396
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,080
crop what's that we've left out the

397
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,120
environment

398
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,240
oh okay well of course yeah more people

399
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,600
are looking at having a

400
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,559
plant-based diet there is a growing

401
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,880
popularity for that but also a growing

402
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,000
popularity

403
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,039
for picking foods that are good for the

404
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,360
environment that don't hurt the earth

405
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,760
by us growing them and eating them it

406
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,280
says the environment

407
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,400
is also a factor and choosing

408
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,679
legumes such as soy over meat

409
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,720
for our meals could reduce greenhouse

410
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,679
gases

411
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,880
and conserve water and land use

412
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,679
basically this sentence is saying soy is

413
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,280
better for the earth

414
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,600
than eating meat if everyone switched

415
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,039
from meat to soy

416
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,280
the earth would be very happy we would

417
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,440
reduce greenhouse gases

418
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,320
co2 levels would go down because cows

419
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,360
make a lot of

420
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,840
greenhouse gas and also we would save a

421
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,520
lot of water and land

422
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,080
water that we use to feed you know to

423
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,360
give to animals and

424
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,760
land that they have to grow that the

425
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,360
animals need to grow on

426
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,760
we talk about legumes here that's just a

427
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,720
category

428
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
of kind of vegetables we put beans in

429
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,159
there we put

430
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,720
peas in there these are legumes so

431
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,320
they're a little bit different from

432
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,039
you know cabbage and other fruits and

433
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,720
things like that it's basically

434
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,640
beans this is that family of legumes

435
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,919
anyway soybeans everyone is healthful

436
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,440
simple to grow and less harmful to the

437
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,960
environment

438
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,559
it's fair to say that soybeans

439
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,799
truly are uh

440
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,360
miracle crop where's the choir oh there

441
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,600
we go

442
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,320
lovely now it's time for the one

443
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,679
question

444
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,360
mike yes what's your favorite way

445
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,640
to eat soy that's a good question

446
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,440
well i'd say at least in my personal

447
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,520
kitchen at home

448
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,559
no i've never had tofurkey i love to eat

449
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,960
soy sauce i mean i have that at home and

450
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,360
i

451
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,919
put that on certain dishes but i'd have

452
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:42,880
to say

453
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,840
stinky tofu i love to eat cho dofu

454
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,760
especially the fried kind

455
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,080
and i do enjoy that but i don't eat it

456
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,600
at home very often

457
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,760
because it does tend to kind of smell up

458
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,640
the place

459
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,799
but if i go to a night market i will

460
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,240
enjoy a nice plate

466
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,919
you may think the name silicon valley

467
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:52,480
sounds

468
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,279
very strange actually the name of

469
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,480
silicon valley

470
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,360
refers to the large number of silicon

471
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,039
computer chip makers

472
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,400
in this area of course silicon valley

473
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,520
is no longer just a center for computer

474
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,880
chip companies

475
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,120
it is also the home of important

476
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,159

481
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,360
smaller companies as they grew

482
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,480

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,360
these days silicon valley is one of the

484
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,000

an area that

492
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,120
