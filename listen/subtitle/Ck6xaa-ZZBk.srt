the world as Wonder Woman these days but

70
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,900
she's been acting for quite a while did

71
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,480
you know she was in the original Fast &

72
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,170
Furious movie back in 2009 so it might

73
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,540
seem like she just appeared on the scene

74
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,540
but she's actually been in been in big

75
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,000
Hollywood movies for a while but she

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,890
started her life in Israel joined the

when she left she became a model and

79
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,780
then an actress so today we're gonna be

80
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,299
learning more about her now and into the

81
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:07,390
future especially her relationship to

82
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,120
this great Wonder Woman film franchise

83
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,880
there you go Wonder Woman Wonder Woman

84
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,298
the movie broke box office records and

85
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,048
turned gadot into a household name so

86
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:21,190
before Hey

87
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,350
she was relatively famous a little bit

88
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,120
filming a little bit a little bit famous

89
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,100
I should say she had been in some big

90
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,440
movies but Wonder Woman took her to that

91
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,740
next level of Fame mmm that's right it

92
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,950
turned her into a household name we used

93
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,590
this phrase yesterday basically when we

94
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,350
call someone a household name we mean

95
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,450
that they are so well known that

96
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,700
everyone has heard of this person

97
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,880
everyone in your household now the idea

98
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,680
here being is that there are probably a

99
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,350
few generations in your household things

100
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,870
that your parents know famous names that

101
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,060
your parents know might not be known to

102
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,639
the kids or the grandparents and vice

103
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,860
versa but if someone is a household name

104
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,130
that means everyone is her has heard of

105
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,530
this thing even if they're not that the

106
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,960
right age or if they're not a big fan or

107
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,770
something like that

108
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,520
it's just so well known for example the

109
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,910
designer is quickly becoming a household

110
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,570
name something like Coco Chanel would be

111
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:24,970
a household name as opposed to some of

112
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,919
the more unknown or younger designers

113
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,180
pretty much everybody everybody no

114
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:31,990

115
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,850

00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,680
you know about her she's a household

117
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,900

118
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,650
of fame and there's more she became one

119
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,800

122
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,690
influential people how about that now

123
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:59,080
here we have the adverb globally let's

124
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,480
say you are globally famous you are

00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,120

matter where on the globe you are for

129
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,040
example Saturday's concert will be

130
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,370
broadcast globally all around the world

131
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,680
there you go and so what has she used

132
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,590
this Fame for how has she used her

133
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:26,410
influence it sells gadot used her fame

134
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,970
to work with pencils of promise an

135
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,640
organization promoting equal access to

136
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,920
education for children this sounds like

137
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,380
a great organization this is probably a

138
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,690
charity it's probably safe to bet that

139
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,630
pencils for promise this organization is

140
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,340
a charity and they work to promote

141
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,460
access to education for kids getting

142
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,430
more kids in school is always a good

143
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,950
thing and I would promote that any day

144
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,110
to promote something it's kind of like

145
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,020
to advertise you're bringing attention

146
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,000
to something companies will promote new

147
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,590
products in the same way that they

148
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,230
advertise new products if you're

149
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,360
supporting something you're promoting it

150
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,980
maybe your friend is opening a business

151
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,140
and you're helping them give out flyers

152
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,660
or put up signs or something like that

153
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,820
or maybe it's just something that you

154
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,800
believe in maybe you've decided to

155
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,320
become vegan and stop eating meat and

156
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,180
you work with other groups or other

157
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,880
friends to promote the idea of eating

158
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,920
meat-free talking about how good it is

159
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,380
and getting other people to try it out

160
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,970
or at least learn about it

161
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:33,280
for example the organization put up

162
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,010
posters around town to promote awareness

163
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:38,410
of climate change they think it's

164
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,630
important and they want more attention

165
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,490
to be paid on paid to it there

166
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,250
now we also have the word access to talk

167
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,580
about here it's being used as a noun if

168
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,759
you have access to something you can use

169
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,819
that thing it is available to you okay

170
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:56,919
it's easy to get to that's all there is

171
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,440
to it now if you access something you

172
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,539
can use this word as a verb too when you

173
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:04,569
access something you do something so as

174
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:07,840
to be able to use that thing so access

175
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,030
is when you can use that thing but when

176
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:11,800
you are using that thing you can be said

177
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,830
to be accessing that thing for example

178
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,800
various politicians have promised the

179
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,979
country's citizens better access to

180
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,009
medical care so so before maybe it

181
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,870
wasn't easy to get that metal medical

182
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,240
care now it's going to be easy to get

183
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,789
that okay and we use that medical care

184
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:33,429
mm-hmm pencils of promise of course

185
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,130
bringing education to kids is a really

186
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,229
good thing and I think almost anyone

187
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:40,510
would agree to that but if you're like

188
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,669
gal gadot maybe there's a slightly more

189
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,470
personal reason you want to promote

190
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:47,170
education and children we read as a

191
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:50,380
mother of two it should come as no

192
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,620
surprise that she is using her fame to

193
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,020
raise funds to build schools in

194
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:59,050
underprivileged areas around the world

195
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,450
yeah everyone can agree that kids need

196
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,720
education poor kids more than most but

197
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,490
if you're a mother if you have your own

198
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,140
kids and you're thinking about their

199
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,300
education and then you look at similar

200
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,490
kids who just don't have the money and

201
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,829
think it's unfair that they can't have

202
00:09:14,829 --> 00:09:16,720
an education then that you know might

203
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,240
push you to use your influence to

204
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,670
promote this and to raise funds to help

205
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,970
out to because what to charities need

206
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,950
charities need money and what our funds

207
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,250
funds are money that's basically all it

208
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,529
is this is a noun form we generally use

209
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:36,430
an S because having a fund is doesn't

210
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,800
really make a lot of sense in this kind

211
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,540
of way and if you want to do something

212
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,490
you need lots of money so you're gonna

213
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,890
raise lots of funds or just funds in

214
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,839
general you're gonna raise money in

215
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:49,209
order to do something funds or the money

216
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:51,670
you use in order to do something for

217
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:54,760

in the latest Wonder Woman movie

263
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,110
Wonder Woman 1984 however in addition to

264
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,390
her superhero duties she has started

265
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,980
working as a producer with her own

266
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,829
production company among other projects

267
00:11:59,829 --> 00:12:01,839
the company is adapting the life stories

268
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,850
of several strong women throughout

269
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,209
history such as Irena Sendler a Polish

270
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:09,520
social worker who saved dozens of

271
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,280
Jewish children from the Holocaust gadot

272
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,140
will perform in these projects to

273
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:16,060
continue as an example for women and

274
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:23,080
girls around the world ok let's start to

275
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,650
learn about Wonder Woman - the sequel to

276
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,170
the first Wonder Woman movie yeah

277
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:32,680
recently gadot reprised the role the

278
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,740
role of Wonder Woman she reprised or

279
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,230
played again the role that made her

280
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,220
famous in the latest Wonder Woman movie

281
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,470
Wonder Woman

282
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,510
1984 so it's not going by the title

283
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,660
Wonder Woman - it's going by this title

284
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,150
Wonder Woman

285
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,890
1984 which leads me to believe that this

286
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:57,100
movie takes place in 1984

287
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,140
yeah or we've missed a whole lot of

288
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,160
seagulls yeah I don't think this is the

289
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,350
1984 this it's most definitely not so

290
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,500
it's set in the year 1984 cool lots of

291
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,460
great 80s music and fashions however in

292
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:15,880
addition to her superhero duties she gal

293
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,800
gadot she has started working as a

294
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,650
producer with her own production company

295
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,980
yeah a lot of Hollywood actors are doing

296
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,660
this these days when they get some power

297
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,300
and money they often use it to do really

298
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,700
good things like making good films I

299
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,280
think Margot Robbie is a good example of

300
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,170
that I'm gonna do good things with my

301
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,480

and not all just superhero epics and I

304
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,480
think Margot Robbie is a good example

305
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,360
young talented actor has now become a

306
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,760

311
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,830
strong women throughout history such as

312
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,640
Irena Sendler a Polish social worker who

313
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,610

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:19,210
these interesting strong but kind of

318

00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:40,190

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:46,850

00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,000
great star a great actress but her fame

380
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,119
she's used it in a really good way yeah

381
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,240
exactly with her strength and kind heart

382
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,050
this wonder of a woman is just the kind

383
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:18,050
of role model we need today so she's not

384
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,170
just selling luxury products and hanging

385
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,569
out with celebrities on expensive yachts

386
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:26,959
she's using her power and her money to

387
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,970
do really good things because not

388
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,520
everyone uses their power and money to

389
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,380
do good things sometimes they just kind

390
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,270
of waste it so there you go well done

391
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,220
gal gadot we look forward to those

392
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,500
movies both Wonder Woman and actually

393
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,270
I'm more interested in the movies she'll

394
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,980
make with her own company those sound

395
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,080
really cool here's our what do you think

396
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,179
question sir what is the question for

397
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:50,690
today Mike yes what qualities make gal

398
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,990
gadot a great role model and you can't

399
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,280
say Wow oh then I can't oh no I know

400
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,860
several qualities make her a great role

401
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:03,230
model first she's not your typical

402
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,570
Hollywood person who's only concerned

403
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:10,130
with right and she wants to give back to

404
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,809
the community she's working with a

405
00:18:11,809 --> 00:18:14,419
charity that I'd say is a great charity

406
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,820
because they actually you know you can

407
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,130
see the work they do it's not just sort

408
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,350
of giving money to some big charity and

409
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,980
it kind of gets lost already that too

410
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,140
but I think pencils for kids and buying

411
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,450
books for kids and building schools and

412
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,240
poor areas that will actually you'll see

413
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,010
some good effects of that so I think

414
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,110
that's another good quality she's

415
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,850
working with good charities that are

416
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,179
doing real work these days sounds off

417
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:43,220
with her power and motor power and money

418
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,430
anyways folks with that our

419
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,350
