capable patrick thinks that his son is

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,120
a very capable young man phenomenon

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,239
phenomenon last night i saw an unusual

12
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,360
phenomenon

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,320
bright lights in the sky above my house

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,879
wow

15
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,559

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,680
confidence confidence chris lacks

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,479
confidence

20
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,320
so he doesn't often speak up in class

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,600
advantage advantage kyle took advantage

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,000
of the

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,280
great weather and did some gardening

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,680
so we're still talking about this batman

25
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,560
effect you know

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,119
thinking that you are a superhero or

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:21,759
something

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,200
yeah i think now a lot of people do this

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
for example beyonce yeah

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,840
beyonce did this uh she pretended

31
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,640
to be a person she invented that's right

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,479
called sasha fierce

33
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,079
because i think she was a little bit

34
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,479
nervous about performing in front of a

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,479
large crowd right yeah because you'll

36
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,000
have stage fright

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,960
right but she imagined to be that person

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,360
instead of focusing on herself

39
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,560
that's right because she has

40
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,720
insecurities or she might think she has

41
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,479
some weaknesses or

42
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,079
she might fail she takes herself out of

43
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,119
her

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,520
body and puts it into this very

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,159
character

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,280
yeah do you ever do that

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,000
in fact i really do do this i do this

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,878
i'll think of like

49
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,920
mentors that i have like my father or

50
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,360
somebody like that

51
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,080
and i will imagine to myself what would

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,720
he do

53
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,360
in this situation and because you know

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,120
mentors to you are kind of like

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,440
superheroes like role models superheroes

56
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,239
right so

57
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,440
you think well if they could do it then

58
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,239
i could do it right and it makes you

59
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,400
just feel like okay

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,959
it's possible that just proves that your

61
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,000
mind can be

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,400
really really powerful it's definitely

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,760
true that's the point

64
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,680
exactly and believe in yourself that's

65
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,800
right okay

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
enjoy today's lesson enjoy it whoever

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,959
you are

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,360
i can do it i'm batman the batman effect

69
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,519
works by allowing people to distance

70
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,120
themselves from their negative

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,920
emotions by pretending they are someone

72
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,280
highly capable

73
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,440
people in high stress situations are

74
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,280
able to better persevere through

75
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,370
challenges

76
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:10,319
[Music]

77
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,319
today's lesson is called i can do it

78
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,159
i'm batman part two hello everyone my

79
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:19,040
name is jeff

80
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,360
and i'm mike and it might sound crazy

81
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,519
but yes you can do it

82
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,879
you are batman or you can do it if you

83
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,599
think you are batman as we learned

84
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,239
yesterday a psychological study with a

85
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:33,599
group of kids

86
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,200
found that when they're asked to do

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,640
something difficult

88
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,480
the kids who believed that they could

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,680
because they're

90
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,640
batman they did much better and they

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,000
worked much harder

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,440
than the kids who just thought of

93
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,120
themselves in good ways

94
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,599
but not as a superhero or someone

95
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,480
amazing

96
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,720
like batman so believe you're batman

97
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,760
you'll do better

98
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,879
the batman effect it's a thing backed

99
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,840
by science amazing amazing the batman

100
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,280
effect by the way

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,319
works by allowing people to

102
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,239
distance themselves from their negative

103
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,599
emotions they're not thinking oh

104
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,040
i'm just i'm i did badly

105
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,320
i did badly i make mistakes all the time

106
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,839
they're thinking

107
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,400
i'm batman i'm not i'm not gonna take a

108
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,240
break a break does batman

109
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,040
take breaks no way we're gonna get to

110
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,080
the bottom of this

111
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,600
now cause i'm batman i'm batman

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,840
exactly and of course batman works hard

113
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,919
he doesn't take breaks and he's really

114
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:36,400
good

115
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,040
right he always wins he always finds a

116
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
way to fight through

117
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,520
so by pretending they are someone highly

118
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,360
capable people in high stress situations

119
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
are able to better

120
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,080
persevere through challenges they won't

121
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,960
give up they'll

122
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,199
fight on they'll continue working

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,560
they'll persevere

124
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,800
even through difficult things even

125
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,960
through a challenge you believe

126
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
that you can do it you have the skills

127
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,080
the talent

128
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
everything you need you are highly

130
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,720

154
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
example of someone making use of this

155
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,479
phenomenon

156
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,280
is the pop star beyonce in the early

157
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,000
days of her

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,479
career beyonce would feel nervous about

159
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,560
performing in front of people

160
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,880
to deal with this she'd often imagine

161
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,199
herself as a super confident singer

162
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,759
named

163
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,880
sasha fierce as sasha fierce

164
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,400
she could perform with all the

165
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,479
confidence she didn't believe herself to

166
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,440
have

167
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,840
and now she's one of the most celebrated

168
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,960
live performers in the world

169
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,000
[Music]

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
okay one famous example of someone

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,639
making use of this phenomenon

172
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,639
is the pop star beyonce

173
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,680
batman well we'll learn

174
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,160
more about we'll learn more about that

175
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,960
later on

176
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
but yes you might think no one actually

177
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,240
uses this no there are pop stars who use

178
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,639
this

179
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,840
technique they don't say i'm batman

180
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,560
let's say

181
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,039
but they might use this technique they

182
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,000
might use

183
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,879
a technique like this to distance

184
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,240
themselves

185
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,520
from their negative emotions ah

186
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,120
interesting and when we talk about a

187
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
phenomenon we're talking about something

188
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:09,840
that is

189
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,319
kind of a strange occurrence but it

190
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:12,960
might be

191
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,840
real it probably is real but it's kind

192
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,840
of unusual the kind of thing that you

193
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,599
would first read about or hear about and

194
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,599
go that can't be true

195
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,160
that can't be real but it is real for

196
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,960
example you know

197
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
the northern lights is one of those

198
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,240
amazing natural

199
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,479
phenomenon it doesn't happen all the

200
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,519
time it's kind of mysterious and strange

201
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:34,479
how it happens

202
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,120
but it does actually happen it actually

203
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,839
has

204
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,799
you know a reason in science for this to

205
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,919
go on but still

206
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,959
it seems very unusual like the batman

207
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,800
effect if you just read about this you'd

208
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
go come on

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,680
but if you read the studies and the

210
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,040
research you find out

211
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,480
no it's real it's just very unusual

212
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,160
for example last night i saw an unusual

213
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,360
phenomenon

214
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,959
bright lights in the sky above my house

215
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,240
okay in the early days of her career

216
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,760
right beyonce would feel nervous

217
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,399
about performing in front of people

218
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,600
stage fright yeah

219
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
even the queen bee there she felt

220
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,839
nervous in front of a large group of

221
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:20,560
people

222
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,680
if you are nervous you are on edge

223
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,160
you're

224
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,959
anxious you're worried you're really

225
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:32,480
jittery i know that here in taiwan

226
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,600
people are really nervous about

227
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,640
giving presentations where they have to

228
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,680
talk in front of many

229
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,240
people it makes them very nervous very

230
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,120
uncomfortable for example joy is feeling

231
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,000
nervous about her big speech tomorrow

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,040
she doesn't want to

233
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,080
embarrass herself or something like that

234
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,000
she just doesn't want to make a fool of

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,680
herself in front of a lot

236
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,959
of people so beyonce

237
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,480
yeah even queen bee herself

238
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,440
she used the batman effect to her

239
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,360
advantage yeah as you said people are

240
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,600
nervous in taiwan all around the world

241
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,240
about

242
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,560
speaking in front of people or even

243
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,279
artists

244
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,240
well-known artists get stage fright they

245
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,839
get nervous about performing

246
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,399
dancing singing playing their instrument

247
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,720
in front of an audience so to deal with

248
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,440
this

249
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,760
she that's beyonce to deal with this

250
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,720
she'd often

251
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,760
imagine herself as a super confident

252
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,040
singer named sasha fierce

253
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,640
interesting so she kind of turned

254
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,640
herself into a superhero

255
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,880
but not a superhero just a different

256
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,040
person with a lot of confidence

257
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,079
and a different name same effect

258
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,200
as sasha fierce she could perform with

259
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,760
all the confidence she didn't believe

260
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,720
herself

261
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,519
to have beyonce doesn't have this this

262
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,160
confidence

263
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,640
beyonce is nervous sasha fierce she

264
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,040
could walk through a brick wall she's so

265
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,720
confident and powerful

266
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,120
getting rid of she got rid of those

267
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,040
negative emotions

268
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,680
and all that was left was that

269
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,480
confidence

270
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,160
yeah that's right she got rid of that

271
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,640
negative emotions by pretending to be

272
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,600
a different more capable person and use

273
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
as you said it gave her confidence

274
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,839
confidence is when you believe in

275
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,880
yourself

276
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,640
you believe that you can do it you

277
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,200
believe in your skills and your talents

278
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
you believe in your training and your

279
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
knowledge as well but you're not like i

280
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,920
can't

281
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,000
no you're like i can it might be

282
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,120
difficult but

283
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,320
i can do it i believe in myself i have

284
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,120
confidence

285
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,800
for example chris lacks confidence

286
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,839
so he doesn't often speak up in class he

287
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,240
gets

288
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
nervous he doesn't have what if i say

289
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,000
the wrong

290
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,800
thing or ask a stupid question or you

291
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,000
know he doesn't believe

292
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,040
himself he lacks confidence so did it

[Music]

305
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,720
a super confident singer named

306
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,079
shimoshima shijonjigan named shiyo who

307
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,600
is named jinhua

308
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,920
means

309
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,040
i'm kind of

310
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,880
dana is looking at a portrait that was

311
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,839
painted by a local artist dina jones

312
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,079
that was painted by a local artist

313
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,639
that was painted

314
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,040
dana is looking at a portrait painted by

315
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,079
a local artist

316
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,880
i can do it i'm batman if we take

317
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,959
advantage of the batman effect

318
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,040
then we should all be able to improve

319
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,399
our performance

320
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,720
what's more there's no reason to limit

321
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,759
yourself to just

322
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,320
one other identity if you're facing a

323
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,120
personal difficulty temporarily take on

324
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,079
the identity of a wise family member

325
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,240
if you're running a race perhaps imagine

326
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,839
yourself as usain bolt

327
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,800
the legendary sprinter choose whatever

328
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,839
identity is best for the task at hand

329
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,000
with just a little creative thinking

330
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,680
every one of us can become

331
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,839
a little more like the person we wish to

332
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,570
be

333
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,480
[Music]

334
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,639
okay if we take advantage of the batman

335
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,839
effect

336
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,040
then we should all be able to

337
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,839
improve our performance so there you go

338
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,759
if you think you are

339
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,120
lagging behind in school or at work

340
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,680
take advantage of the batman effect or

341
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,440
the sasha fierce effect

342
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,920
say i'm batman or say i'm sasha fierce

343
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,959
okay take advantage of this and

344
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,880
improve your performance anyways here we

345
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,400
have this word

346
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,839
advantage okay if you take advantage of

347
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,280
a situation

348
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,400
okay you exploit it you get the most

349
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,439
out of it that you can okay you take as

350
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,119
much benefit from it

351
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,880
as you can now you can exploit

352
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,160
or take advantage of situations but you

353
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,160
shouldn't take advantage of

354
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,360
people a small note there for example

355
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,160
kyle took advantage of the great weather

356
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,080
and did some gardening there you go

357
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,799
i've got a great day so i'm going to do

358
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,840
me some

359
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,880
gardening i'm going to get as much

360
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,400
benefit from this day

361
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,240
as is humanly possible gardening wise

362
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
all right then so yeah an advantage can

363
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,360
be something that

364
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,760
makes you better able to compete gives

365
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,799
you an edge

366
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,039
but also when we use it this way take

367
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:57,919
advantage

368
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,039
of we're using something to give us that

369
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:01,679
edge

370
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,280
all right very cool so yeah take

371
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,520
advantage of the batman effect let's

372
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
move on and see what it says next what's

373
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,160
more

374
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,640
there's more to it there's no reason to

375
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,760
limit yourself

376
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,120
to just one other identity ah so if it's

377
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,440
a

378
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,160
tough challenge you're batman if it's a

379
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,000
problem of feeling nervous in front of

380
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,559
people

381
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,880
you're sasha fierce you can change it

382
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,840
depending

383
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,640
on the situation be whoever you want

384
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,080
whoever helps you

385
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,240
fight that battle that you're facing if

386
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,720
you're facing a personal difficulty

387
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,679
temporarily take on the identity of a

388
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,320
wise

389
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,799
family member oh it's a difficult choice

390
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,919
what should i do

391
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,919
what would my grandmother do what would

392
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,440
my grandfather do

393
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,880
use their wisdom or let's say

394
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,679
you're running a race perhaps imagine

395
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,840
yourself as usain bolt

396
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,480
the legendary sprinter probably as fast

397
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:54,880
as him

398
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,280
probably one of the greatest runners of

399
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,080
all time

400
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,600
i'm using bolt and there you go you

401
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,799
run run run yourself to the front of

402
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,640
the pack but you have to eat chicken

403
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
nuggets first because he always used to

404
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,120
do that

405
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
anyways let's go ahead and move on

406
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,440
choose whatever identity is best

407
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,559
for the task at hand with just a little

408
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,000
creative thinking

409
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,840
every one of us can become a little more

410
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,960
like the person

411
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,679
we wish to be again though we're not

412
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,480
trying to

413
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,200
become batman we're just trying to

414
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,960
distance ourselves

415
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,000
from negative emotions

416
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,039
that's the true point here anyways

417
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,080
mike do you think you'd be interested

418
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,640
in making use of the batman effect in

419
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,000
your daily life

420
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,280
or if you already use it

421
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,760
how do you feel about it that's very

422
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,440
interesting well i've never really used

423
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,760
the batman effect before but you know if

424
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,080
i'm physically tired i might think of

425
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,880
people in

426
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,200
in history who are physically tired but

427
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,640
kept on going

428
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,480
you know so if it's at the end of a long

429
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,320
day and i didn't sleep well

430
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,120
i might think of an explorer shackleton

431
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,120
wandering through the desert or across

432
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,440
the ice with heavy loads on their back

433
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,280
and think well that guy walked for

434
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,919
five days with no rest i can make it to

435
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:18,880
this evening

436
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,039
so you know that kind of thing it's kind

437
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,320
of a way of saying you know

438
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,880
i might be bad now but it could be a lot

439
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,159
worse

440
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,600
it's a different way of thinking about

441
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,120
it but still it gives you that

442
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,080
motivation

443
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,400
to keep on going i like it all right

444
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,120
folks

445
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,679
that's it for us and it's time for us to

446
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,400
say

447
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,440
bye-bye take care of

448
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,840
the leads

449
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,440
she can whip up a meal with whatever

450
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,240
ingredients

451
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,840
are left in the fridge taken

452
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,759
[Music]

453
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,600
[Music]

454
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,640
welcome to niagara falls

455
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,919
i hope you like water because we have a

456
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,440
lot of it here

457
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,840
this place is called niagara falls

458
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,880
because it is

459
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,400
actually made up of three waterfalls

460
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
there is also an island between two of

461
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
the falls it's called

462
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,360
goat island no there are no goats there

463
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,840
the island got its name after a man

464
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,360
named john steadman

465
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,320
brought his goats to the island stedman

466
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,520
brought his goats there

467
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,559
to protect them from wolves but the cold

468
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,120
winter

469
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,240
killed most of steadman's goats when

470
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,720
british soldiers heard this story

471
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,840
they called the island goat island

472
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,679
here's another interesting fact about

473
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,360
niagara falls

474
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,480
in 2012 a man named nick

475
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,760
wallenda walked on a rope across

476
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,679
the falls since niagara falls is located

477
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:02,640
on the border

478
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,120
between the united states and canada

479
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,919
wallenda

480
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,400
had to present his passport when he

481
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,960
arrived on the canadian side

482
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,480
isn't that funny here is more

483
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,200
information

484
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,400
waterfall that river comes down in a

485
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,360
waterfall

486
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,840
off the cliff border

487
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,799
this train will cross the border between

488
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,520
china

489
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,520
and india glacier

490
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,320
these glaciers are made of layers of

491
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,279
solid ice

492
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,919
hydropower hydropower is produced by the

493
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,600
energy of falling water

494
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,440
or fast running water

495
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,679
drain the men used a big pipe to

496
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,799
drain the water from the pool and then

497
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,159
cleaned it

498
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,080
separate the two countries are separated

499
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,520
by a tall mountain

500
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,559
erosion soil erosion

501
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,679
by rain in this city is very serious

502
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,720
veil the bride's face was

503
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,559
covered by a white veil

504
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,919
missed the small village

505
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,840
disappeared in the mist

506
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,200
preservation the students are working

507
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,679
for

508
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,039
environmental preservation

509
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,279
today's lesson was quite fascinating

510
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,159
right

511
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,960

512
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,080
