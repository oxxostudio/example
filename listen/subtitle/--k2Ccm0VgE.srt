00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:50,810
them with the reporter telling them this

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,399

00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,459
just sounds absurd that's crazy and I

39
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:10,038
think that the reporter thinks these

40
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:11,810
guys are just going to get themselves

41
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:12,740

43
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,940
big trouble right yeah that's not a very

44
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,010
good plan exactly but he helps them he

45
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,319
like gives them a map in the books and

46
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:25,670

50
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,880
getting a bag and the reporter didn't

51
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,270
even recognize because he looks so awful

52
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,580
she was in an awful State right and I

54
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,350
time when there were in Afghanistan and

55
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,090
they had to eat their own camel whole

56
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:49,760

00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,880
if they come across as being shady but

186
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,520
even though peachy seems Shady this

187
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,250
reporter decides to relay the message as

188
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:44,280
he was asked so then we read a few days

189
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,970
later both peachy and Dravo turn up at

190
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,760
the reporters office with details of

191
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,670
their upcoming plan interesting so the

192
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,920
reporter thought as long as he passed on

193
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,870
the message that would be the end of it

194
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,200
for him but no because later these two

195
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,570
associates peachy and drove oh they turn

196
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,910
up they show up they come to the

197
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,820
reporters office in a surprising way in

198
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,270
an unexpected way with details of their

199
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,030
upcoming plan they have a plan it's

200
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,250

203
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,820

there living there to become king

206
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,320

they're going to Lord and rule over the

211
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,400
people who live there the locals this is

212
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,700
kind of a shady plan yeah sounds weird

213
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,250
anyways the reporter warns them about

214
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,010
the dangers of their trip but their

215
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,890
minds were made up yeah we're going and

216
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,710
we're going to become kings this is

217
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,200
awesome by the way here it says that the

218
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,520
reporter

219
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,360
warns them ie the reporter says hey be

220
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,940
careful ok watch your step

221
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,820
something scary maybe or dangerous or

222
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,540
risky awaits you so be careful yes when

223
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,580
you say things like this to someone else

224
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,360
you are warning them for example Cindy's

225
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,420
mother warned her not to get too close

226
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,620
to the hot stove ok so be careful the

227
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,740
stove is hot don't touch the stove or be

228
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,080
careful if you go to that foreign

229
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,690
country and be try to become a king

230
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,510
the local people won't like it that's a

231
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,220
good thing to be warned about who are

232
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,560
you to be our King you just showed up on

233
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,900
a truck you're right arrived on a train

234
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,090
and I hear the king that's not gonna

235
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,250
work but it seems pretty weird but

236
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,680
anyways peachy and drove oh they seem to

237
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,960
know that their plan won't work without

238
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,780
a bit of help so we read they ask for

239
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,600
his assistance and he this is the

240
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,480
reporter and he believing they will be

241
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,210
killed on this adventure gives them a

242
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,990
map and books about the area ok so they

243
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,630
came to him this reporter for assistance

244
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,270
assistance is a noun and as I mentioned

245
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,890
earlier they came to the reporter for

246
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,770
help help and assistance are basically

247
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,960
the same thing if you're asking someone

248
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,240
for assistance you're asking someone for

249
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,330
help you need them to sort of add their

250
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,300
efforts to yours in order to succeed in

251
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,460
doing something if you ask someone for

252
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,410
assistance on the street you might be

253
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,210
lost and you need someone to give you

254
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,340
help to show you the right way in this

255
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:43,260
case they needed help they needed

256
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,810
information and that came from the

257
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,480
reporter in a map and a book we're

258
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,710
interesting let's look at our example

259
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,800
sentence for assistance I could really

260
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,650
use your assistance on this project and

261
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,840
yes if you put in the word help in that

262
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,240
sentence it would be just fine as well

263
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,250
we'll take a quick break and then with

264
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,290

up at the reporters doorstep with a bag

306
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,780
it is none other than peachy Carnahan

307
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,580
whom the reporter almost didn't

308
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,620
recognize at first for he was in an

309
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,720
awful State

310
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,640
seemingly driven mad peachy tells the

311
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,860
reporter that he and Revo suffered great

312
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,750
hardships on their journey took a fierce

313
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,820
tan and were even forced to eat their

314
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,640
own camels and mules along the way when

315
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,560
they finally arrived they used their

316
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,480
guns to help a group of locals win a

317
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,170
civil war

318
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:20,270
okay let's get back into the story so

319
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,510
two people are gonna go to Afghanistan

320
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,450
and become kings of the locals there

321
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,000
that's the plas sounds like a really

322
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,570
strange plan and risky - anyways two

323
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,600
years passed and our story and the

324
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,600
crippled man shows up at the reporters

325
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,230
doorstep with a bag so there's a man

326
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,060
he's crippled probably can't walk

327
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:47,060
properly anymore or looks like he's hurt

328
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,130
in some way so he can't function like a

329
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,710
normal person this person shows up and

330
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,230
they've got a bag well who is this

331
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,830
person

332
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:57,680
peachie karna the exactly let's read on

333
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,410
it says it is none other than peachy

334
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,920
carnahan whom the reporter almost didn't

335
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,160
recognize at first for he was in an

336
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,700
awful state so it's a big surprise

337
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,590
peachy karna hands back two years later

338
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:15,650
but the reporter almost couldn't tell

339
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:18,320
that it was him because peachy was in an

340
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,260
awful state he looked terrible his hair

341
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,630
was dirty and matted as clothes were

342
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,880
ripped he's crippled he's crippled it

343
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,740
looks like he was twenty years older

344
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,720
than he was even though it was just two

345
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,270
years ago so the reporter could barely

346
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,930
recognize him amazing what has happened

347
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,840
- peachy karna must have a story to tell

348
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,600
anyways here yes to recognize something

349
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,600
is to identify that thing when you look

350
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,430
at something and you can tell what it is

351
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,490
you have recognized it so let's say you

352
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,800
see a friend a familiar face you can

353
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,170
recognize that face immediately you know

354
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,500
who they are for example it's been so

355
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,810
long since we've seen each other that I

356
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,020
didn't recognize you at first yeah now

357
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,090
that I've got a good view of you okay I

358
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:07,250
can know I know who you are but before

359
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,160
you look different I couldn't recognize

360
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,740
you all right so let's hear peachy's

361
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,750
story and hopefully that will explain

362
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,480
where he's been for two years and why he

363
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,300
looks so terrible right now we read

364
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,170
seemingly driven mad peach he tells the

365
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,290
reporter that he and Dravo suffered

366
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,230
