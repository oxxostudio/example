the life of a pro gamer for professional

192
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,100
gamers playing is a full-time job

193
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,620
some players practice 50 hours a week

194
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,140
with their team and that's on top of how

195
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,990
much they play alone Korean teams in

196
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,640
particular are known for intense

197
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,220
schedules they practice up to 15 hours

198
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,920
per day during the gaming season that

199
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,080
only leaves time for meals short breaks

200
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,040
and a little sleep

201
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,450
professional gamers everyone they have

202
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,450
to put in a whole lot of work to be pros

203
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,899
yes professional gamers for I should say

204
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,600
for professional gamers playing is a

205
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,029
full-time job oh yeah I get to play

206
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,370
games all the time fantastic

207
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,440
well here if you want to be a pro gamer

208
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,600
you're gonna have to play all the time

209
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,110
it's a full-time job some players

210
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:35,320
practice 40 50 60 hours a week that's

211
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,550
right it's actually more than a

212
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,320
full-time job right because most

213
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,050
full-time jobs would be around 40 40

214
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,880
hours a week five days a week eight

215
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,399
hours a day some players though some

216
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,339
players practice 50 hours a week with

217
00:09:48,339 --> 00:09:51,279
their team and that's on top of how much

218
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,279
they play alone so this isn't total time

219
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,459
this is organized team practice but

220
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,110
imagine if you're organized professional

221
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,089
football player went to the team

222
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:03,310
practice then went home and played more

223
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,649
football just at home by himself in the

224
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:08,050
evening by herself in the evening that's

225
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,880
kind of what it's like so you practice

226
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,829
with the team and then you play on your

227
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:13,420
own so it would probably work out to

228
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,810
what 80 90 hours a week sitting in front

229
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,850
of the computer or whatever playing the

230
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:22,029
same game and Korean teams some of the

231
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:24,070
best in the world Korean teams in

232
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:27,089
particular are known for intense

233
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,149
schedules it's a tough military army

234
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:33,850
like schedule a little very very intense

235
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,649
a little bit of sleep yeah a whole lot

236
00:10:35,649 --> 00:10:37,660
of playing a little bit eating whole lot

237
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,010
of playing that's right a little more

238
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:41,079
sleep living with the same people you

239
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,449
know kind of in a college dorm tie

240
00:10:43,449 --> 00:10:45,550
playing where's very little break from

241
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,050
it there's very little way to get away

242
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,660
and you know get away from your

243
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:51,279
teammates or your job or your work it's

244
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,750
very intense

245
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,790
in other words this adjective is

246
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,140
something we use for something that's

247
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,290
powerful very strong very concentrated

248
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,600
it's a lot going on at once I had a

249
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,449
really intense day my boss yelled at me

250
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:07,269
I lost my phone my dog was sick I had to

251
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:10,089
take it to the vet stuff a lot of crazy

252
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:12,310
things were going on in a very short

253
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:14,380
time we could also use it to say

254
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,750
something's powerful or strong like an

255
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,990
intense storm intense winds during the

256
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:20,560
typhoon

257
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,899
can be very dangerous or someone is

258
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:24,670
always talking and they're serious and

259
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,009
they never smile or crack a joke you

260
00:11:27,009 --> 00:11:29,620
might say man guys really intense he

261
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,300
should relax a little bit

262
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,629
for example during dinner Lindsay had an

263
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,329
intense debate with her uncle over

264
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,550
climate change by the way here we have

265
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,740
the noun scheduled to talk about a

266
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,319
schedule is a document either on your

267
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,180
computer or actually on a piece of paper

268
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,999
that tells you what you'll be doing and

269
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,300
when you'll be doing it so the schedule

270
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,879
for a gamer in Korea might be sleep a

271
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,829
little wake up at 5 a.m.

272
00:11:56,829 --> 00:12:00,519
play games until noon take a 10-minute

273
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,559
lunch break and then play until you go

274
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,059
to sleep again that would be your

275
00:12:04,059 --> 00:12:05,649
schedule well maybe it's not that

276
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:07,809
extreme but hey it's pretty tough

277
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:10,360
anyways for example Darren has a really

278
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,149
busy schedule this week so he can't meet

279
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,370
up with you he just doesn't have any

280
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,279
time now before I before I was what I

281
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,019
was talking about the schedule of a

282
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:22,779
Korean gamer I wasn't kidding get this

283
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:26,250
they practice up to 15 hours per day

284
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,009
during the gaming season so you have 9

285
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:33,339
hours in which to eat sleep and to take

286
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:35,110
care of your personal hygiene Wow

287
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,449
everything else is just gaming so over

288
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:41,829
well over 6 5 that would be what like 75

289
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:44,110
hours or something of playing games a

290
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,850
little bit more than that 50 we

291
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,459
mentioned before so you can see that is

292
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:50,709
very very intense it only leaves a

293
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:53,500
little time for meals short breaks and a

294
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,540
little sleep it's game game game game

295
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,490
they miss dream of the game when they're

296
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,529
sleeping they must brush their teeth

297
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,269
with one hand and continue playing

298
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:03,370
what's the other hand it sounds a little

299
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,259
too intense for me but I don't know

300
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:06,939
anyways let's take a break and then

301
00:13:06,939 --> 00:13:08,709

mostly play exhibition matches against

334
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:41,279
other players these practice games are

335
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,319
often against the very players they will

336
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:46,439
compete against in tournaments just as

337
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:48,389
often pro gamers play online with

338
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,939

okay everyone let's talk some more about

343
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:05,290
pro gaming although some games have

344
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,410
practice modes that players can use to

345
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,680
drill specific skills professional

346
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,999
players pro gamers are so good at every

347
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:19,529
aspect of the game that they mostly play

348
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,120
exhibition matches against other players

349
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,899
yeah

350
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:25,600
the drills in these games these practice

351
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,970
mode drills they're not enough for these

352
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,279
pro pro gamers they have to play

353
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,889
exhibition matches for it to be worth it

354
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:34,620
as far as practice is concerned

355
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,670
interesting but yeah if you're trying to

356
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,589
get good at something especially if it's

357
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:40,689
something involving sports or physical

358
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,600
activity drills are one of the best way

359
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,610
to do it here we're using it as a verb

360
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,740
we can talk about the players are doing

361
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,740
drills or they are drilling different

362
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,660
skills basically it means practicing

363
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,430
something over and over and over again

364
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,920
to become better at it until you finally

365
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,740
get really good until you master this

366
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,410
skill in sports for example in baseball

367
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:04,449
they might have base running drills

368
00:16:04,449 --> 00:16:06,459
where you practice to run around the

369
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,379
bases faster and more efficiently

370
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:11,829
batting drills catching pitching things

371
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:13,749
like that so you do it again and again

372
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:16,059
and again maybe just two players working

373
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,009
together small groups working together

374
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,589
and again it's about the repetition

375
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:22,600
about doing it over and over till it

376
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,699
becomes just part of you and you don't

377
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,980
have to think about it for example the

378
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,559
basketball coach drilled his players on

379
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,329
their shooting skills so they might have

380
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:33,879
spent 40 minutes of one practice just

381
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,429
shooting free-throws

382
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:38,769
we also had the word aspect here we said

383
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:41,709
pro gamers are good at every aspect of

384
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,470
the game at their play they have to be

385
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,319
now what's an aspect though an aspect is

386
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:50,439
a part of something or it's a feature of

387
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:52,059
something and usually we're talking

388
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:54,399
about that harder feature we're saying

389
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,350
that this thing is part of a bigger

390
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,779
thing so there's one thing let's say

391
00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:00,249
we're talking about these players are

392
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:02,949
doing in the game that's the aspect of

393
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:04,209
the game that they're playing at that

394
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,179
moment but the game has many aspects to

395
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,359
it for example social media has become

396
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,530
an important ass

397
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,200
fact of modern life is social media our

398
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,490
entire lives

399
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,040
no but it does play an important part in

400
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,460
our lives now more on these exhibition

401
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,970
or practice games that pro gamers have

402
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,099
to play they have to do these things to

403
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,600
get better because other forms of

404
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,730
practice just aren't enough these

405
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,070
practice games are often against the

406
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,560
very players they will compete against

407
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,020
in tournaments Wow

408
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,340
slaves things yeah they kind of play

409
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,140
exhibitions against the people that

410
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,790
they'll be playing for real

411
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,250
in tournaments okay so this is sort of

412
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,560
like before the basketball season NBA

413
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,660
players might play sort of friendly

414
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,000
games you know go overseas play in other

415
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,740
countries it doesn't count but it's

416
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,870
better than just practicing against your

417
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,180
teammates so they'll do that in pro

418
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,830
gaming I guess it's also a good way to

419
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,420
kind of learn about your opponent's

420
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,910
skills so later on when you're playing

421
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,460
for big money and prizes you have an

422
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,980
idea of how they play it says just as

423
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,950
often pro gamers play online with

424
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,170
ordinary people of course there's lots

425
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:16,840
of game hosting sites where you can go

426
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,240
and find the game find another player in

427
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,490
another part of the world and it could

428
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:24,040
be a pro gamer it says if you start

429
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,130
getting really good at a game you may

430
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,440
find yourself matched with some of your

431
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,260
favorite gaming stars of course your

432
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,030
skill in the game will be high they

433
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,860
probably have rankings based on how many

434
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,590
wins and losses but if you get up there

435
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,900
in the rankings if you're in the top 100

436
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,330
maybe you might be playing against some

437
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,570
famous pro gamers so watch out yeah be

438
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,750
careful they're very very good yes a

439
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,150
