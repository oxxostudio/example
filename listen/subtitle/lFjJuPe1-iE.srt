lot of trouble but finally they get bare

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,360
mm-hmm and they convince the natives

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,729
that they're like an idol they know

27
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,939
Umbra Umbro yeah that's right so it's

28
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,320
like one of the idols so they convinced

29
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,939
that they know an idol God that they

30
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,100

31
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,810
to them said oh oh my god I can't

32
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,030
believe it Thanks the third gods that's

33
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,909
right basically right so they they

34
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:53,610
started telling people what to do giving

35
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,829
orders they're like an army they're

36
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,530
conquering other villages things are

37
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,960
going pretty awesome that's right so

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,530
until until until I remember one of the

39
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,229
guy wanted a wife yeah he got greedy

40
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:14,760
right I want a wife and then I remember

41
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,709
the girl didn't really want to be his

42
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:17,010
wife

43
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:21,000

45
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,430
bleeding but wait gods don't bleed

46
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:29,459
that's right right so they realize they

47
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,080
just realized that hey they're not God

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,950
so they killed him right Daniel Dravot

49
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,740
that's right peachy they crucified him

50
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,780
put him on a cross like this and he

51
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,300
actually survived throughout the night

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,270
so they just let him go so he went back

53
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,720
to India to find the newspaper reporter

54
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,940

00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,440
wondering what's in that bag maybe

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:11,520
right enjoy the man who would be king

60
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,490
soon after Dravo claimed to know Umbra

61
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,220
the idol God the locals worshiped at

62
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,920
this discovery the people began to

63
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,400
worship peachy and Dravo as gods the two

64
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,800
men began wearing crowns of gold upon

65
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,020
their heads they ordered the natives

66
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,420
around train them to use guns and

67
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,480
conquered village after village for

68
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,280
their new empire they established new

69
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,560
farming practices and even a legal

70
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,100
system

71
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,159
today's lesson is called the man who

72
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,939
would be king Park - hello everyone my

73
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:51,370
name is Jeff and I'm Mike and yes it's

74
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,739
part two of our very exciting and

75
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,769
slightly crazy story about peachy

76
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,739
carnahan and Danielle Dravo two

77
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,319
adventurers from about a hundred hundred

78
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,510
and fifty years ago went off to

79
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,170
Afghanistan to become kings of a local

80
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,650
tribe in a foreign country but the plan

81
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,439
that they have these two guys it didn't

82
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,280
go very well

83
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,099
did it no I believe they suffered

84
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:21,430
through a bunch of really bad stuff they

85
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,190
had to eat camels and mules and when

86
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,780
they finally arrived where they were

87
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,919
going they had to participate in a civil

88
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,580
war to fight a war so it yeah I don't

89
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,949
think their plan really worked out also

90
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:39,070
never peachy carnahan he's gone nuts

91
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,840
that's what that's what people think of

92
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,580
him right now he's also been crippled so

93
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,160
yeah things didn't really turn out well

94
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,960
for anyone but he does have that bag

95
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,169
what's in the bag yes that's true he did

96
00:04:50,169 --> 00:04:53,110
show up back in town with a bag that he

97
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,360
brought back from his great adventure so

98
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,430
let's find out about the bag well the

99
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,680
article for today at least begins soon

100
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,720
after soon after telling his story to

101
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,570
the reporter that he met a few years ago

102
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,020
soon after Dravo claimed to know Umbra

103
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:11,440
the idol god the locals worshipped oh so

104
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,300
this would be soon after the civil war

105
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,180
that we just left off with at the end of

106
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,620
yesterday so they got to the village

107
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,080
where they wanted to become kings they

108
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,630
had this war and then soon after Dravo

109
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,199
the other partner in this plan claimed

110
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,430
to know in bruh the idol god the locals

111
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,690
worshipped so these would be the local

112
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,210
Afghan people Afghani people they

113
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,060
worship this God but the God was in the

114
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:40,000
form of an idol there you go an idol and

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,460
here by the way an idol is something

116
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,710
that you worship it's like a god-like

117
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,020
entity maybe a statue or something like

118
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,659
that that people think is holy that they

119
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:52,120
worship you're not talking about a teen

120
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,150
idol here someone who's popular and

121
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,900
famous and that

122
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,880
other people want to be like here no

123
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,860
we're talking about something that is

124
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,770
worshiped an idol for example the

125
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,070
treasure hunter gently lifted the golden

126
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,680
idol from its stand when they when he

127
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,539
said that he had the idol at this

128
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,509
discovery the people began to worship

129
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:17,229
Peachy and drove Oh as gods the sky

130
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:19,509
drove Oh shows up he's from a foreign

131
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,300
country he looks very different he's got

132
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,060
an idol in his bag he must be one of

133
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,220
these odds that's what the local people

134
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,410
were thinking so the plan might just

135
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:32,199
work these people here think that peachy

136
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,440
and drove over gods and yes the two men

137
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,229
began wearing crowns of gold upon their

138
00:06:38,229 --> 00:06:40,660
heads it sounds like they have become

139
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,449
kings that's absolutely right and then

140
00:06:43,449 --> 00:06:46,389
they began to behave like kings even

141
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,280
though of course they had no right to be

142
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,530
the kings of these people or this land

143
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:52,990
but they acted like they were and what

144
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,880
did they do next they ordered the

145
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
natives around told the native the local

146
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,949
people do this get me food build me a

147
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:02,949
house or whatever train them to use guns

148
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,180
and conquered village after village so

149
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,970
these guys are just warlords basically

150
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,159
go out to a country give guns to a bunch

151
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:14,470
of poor people and then use them as

152
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:17,440
their own personal army yeah I'm not

153
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,479
sure this is the right thing to do but

154
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:21,940
again this story is from a long time ago

155
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,370
so they ordered people around like they

156
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,530
were kings they trained the locals to a

157
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,870
to become an army and then they used

158
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,930
that army to conquer the villages in the

159
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,630
nearby area what is it to conquer to

160
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:37,510
conquer is to beat but in a warlike or

161
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,479
military kind of way you won't conquer

162
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,880
the other team in a baseball game you

163
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,710
conquer another country or another

164
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,990
Kingdom if you're playing a video game

165
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,000
or in a history book you know one

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,220
country will start a war and if they

167
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,590
invade another country and win that war

168
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:56,020
then they will conquer that country they

169
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:59,229
come in attack invade and then take over

170
00:07:59,229 --> 00:08:02,020
when the fighting is done for example

171
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,750
the king conquered a large amount of

172
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,180
territory during his rule he made his

173
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,169
kingdom much

174
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:10,449
bigger he took that territory by force

175
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,939
maybe with his army or something like

176
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:16,509
that anyways back to our two kings

177
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:20,590
peachie karna Hannon one mr. Bravo for

178
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,800
their new empire they established new

179
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,770
farming practices and even a legal

180
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:28,870
system before we move on we do have to

181
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:32,139
talk about the noun empire an empire is

182
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:35,289
kind of like a really really big country

183
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,510
but it's slightly different from a from

184
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,979
a country an empire is usually a

185
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,159
collection of countries that are all

186
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,040
ruled by another country that would be

187
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,779
the Emperor by the way the person who

188
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:48,850
ran who runs that country and also the

189
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:51,010
Empire's countries or territories that

190
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,690
would be the Emperor but yes here an

191
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,019
empire is a very large country or a very

192
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:57,820
large collection of companies come

193
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:00,040
countries I should say under the control

194
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,740
of a single person for example even the

195
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,649
mightiest of empires has to come to an

196
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:10,209
end sooner or later ancient Rome Roman

197
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,670
Empire the British Empire they've all

198
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,980
come and gone all right anyways so

199
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,120
they're trying to set up their own

200
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,399
little Empire and to do that they

201
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,740
established laws and some other things

202
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,290
as well what is it to establish this

203
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,720
verb basically means to set something up

204
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,060
it's kind of like to create something we

205
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,240
might also use that word to found

206
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,709
something right you establish something

207
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:35,620
probably big maybe an institution like a

208
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,529
hospital or a university businesses can

209
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:41,079
be established it's when it starts it's

210
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:43,180
when the first large buildings maybe are

211
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,310
put up when the company sort of goes

212
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,070
public with its name and starts hiring

213
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:49,810
workers you know it's the beginning of

214
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,199
some kind of organization like that for

215
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:55,149
example we could also say the government

216
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:58,329
established a national healthcare system

217
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:01,420
in 1911 all right yeah so the government

218
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,389
set up or established this program to

219
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:06,639
give health care to all the people it's

220
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,050
a big thing but it has to begin

221
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,120
somewhere there you go all right folks

222
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,800

who would be king it was all going so

273
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:45,949
well until drove Oh mad with power

274
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:48,410
asked for a wife the bride to be

275
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,919
frightened for her life bit his neck he

276
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:54,410
bled and the locals knowing that gods

277
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:57,199
don't bleed realized that he was an

278
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:00,109
impostor they killed him by forcing him

279
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:02,589
onto a bridge before cutting the ropes

280
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:06,019
for his part peachy was crucified but

281
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,999
when he survived the night they let him

282
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:14,720
go and he returned to India okay so

283
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,169
things started off a little bit violent

284
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:19,549
okay

285
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,489
Bravo and Carnahan were training the

286
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:24,889
locals there in Afghanistan to fight and

287
00:13:24,889 --> 00:13:26,600
use guns and stuff like that but later

288
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,639
on they did some good stuff they

289
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,279
established a legal system and ways of

290
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,889
farming and stuff like that so it was

291
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:39,079
all going so well until travaux mad with

292
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:39,739
power

293
00:13:39,739 --> 00:13:44,749
asked for a wife one of the kings once a

294
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:47,749
queen I suppose but he probably didn't

295
00:13:47,749 --> 00:13:50,209
ask nicely he probably maybe was mad

296
00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:50,869
with power

297
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:52,879
yeah he probably stole the prettiest

298
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,069
girl from her family or something like

299
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:57,319
that because it seems that this woman

300
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,779
who was to marry him didn't really like

301
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,040
the idea of marrying him the bride-to-be

302
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,929
the woman who would be his bride the

303
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:08,540
bride to be frightened for her life bit

304
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,360
his neck I guess he went in for a kiss

305
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,249
and she didn't want to be kissed so she

306
00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:16,309
bit his neck which of course is a

307
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:19,100
natural thing to do but that caused a

308
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,559
strange reaction from all the other

309
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,769
local people once they see that this man

310
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:26,269
had been bitten

311
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:28,850
well what happened they saw blood he

312
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:31,789
bled that's the problem or okay she bit

313
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:34,549
him that's not a problem no then he bled

314
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:36,769
yeah he bled that's okay too and the

315
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:40,069
locals knowing that gods don't bleed not

316
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:42,470
for a God realized that he was an

317
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,959
impostor stars don't bleed you can bite

318
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,030
a God but that God will never

319
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,910
bleed here we've got a bleeding God it

320
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,880
can't be a gun because well gods don't

321
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,490
believe this guy is a fake he's an

322
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,250
imposter the locals know this now

323
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,590
anyways here you've got the verb bleed

324
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,900
to talk about the past tense form is

325
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,950
bled bleed bled bled anyways here this

326
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,230
word bleed it's a verb okay let's say

327
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,900
you've been cut and blood is coming out

328
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,870
of the cut or the wound you are bleeding

329
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,810
there you go yes I've been cut then the

330
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,630
blood is coming out of the wound oh gosh

331
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:22,550
I'm bleeding yikes

332
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,230
that's what's going on here for example

333
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,930
the wounded soldier was bleeding from

334
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,240
his stomach

335
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,190
that's not good and it's not good blood

336
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,530
coming out of your body is generally not

337
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,320
a good thing so if you're bleeding make

338
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,000
sure to take care of that all right so

339
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,100
then what happens so the locals find out

340
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,590
that this this guy isn't a god and then

341
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,960
they probably quickly figure out that

342
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,730
both of them are not gods and it's all

343
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:49,910
been a big trick a big lie these two

344
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,250
foreigners have come in and done a lot

345
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,130
of really bad stuff so what did the

346
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,070
villagers do they killed him they killed

347
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,850
Dravo by forcing him onto a bridge

348
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,400
before cutting the ropes so they forced

349
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,470
him onto one of those rope bridges and

350
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,910
then when he's in the middle they cut

351
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,940
the ropes from both ends and well he's

352
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,670
science again it sounds like an Indiana

353
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:17,090
Jones movie and so that happened to dr.

354
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:19,730
Vose gone he was killed so what about

355
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,400
peepee Carnahan peachy well he's gonna

356
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,740
get punished too for his part for his

357
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:27,650
part in this charade for his part

358
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:32,030
peachie was crucified put on a cross but

359
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,610
when he survived the night they let him

360
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,030
go and he returned to India so he got

361
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,200
away but what's in the bag truly in the

362
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,790
bag there's a bag

363
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,070
anyways folks with that it's time for us

364
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,320
to take a break but don't go away we'll

365
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,690
be right back after this surrender and

366
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,330

the hot Sun and sends him to a mental

403
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,650
hospital that is the last he ever sees

404
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,500
of him a couple of days later peachy

405
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,810

406
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:47,090

is in your bag I want to know and get

409

410
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:01,070
in the bag after finishing his story

411
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,210
peachie reveals the contents of his bag

412
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,289
the crowned head of Dhruv oh and leaves

413
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:13,859
the reporter's office so he just dumps

414
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:17,460
dravot's head in the office there and

415
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,399
leaves a dead smelly head

416
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:21,929
that's gross in a bag that's disgusting

417
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:23,909
that is that is pretty gross but when

418
00:19:23,909 --> 00:19:25,950
you think about a what else was gonna be

419
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:28,109
in the bag he was sent away from the

420
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:30,929
village in disgrace it's not like he was

421
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:33,119
bringing gold back with him but still

422
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,789
that is horrible so there's this

423
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,889
reporter he's got this head in the bag

424
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:40,200
this man just told him the craziest

425
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,509
story he's ever heard what does the

426
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:45,029
reporter do well we read the next day

427
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:48,119
the reporter comes across peachy lying

428
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:51,659
in the hot Sun and sends him to a mental

429
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:55,200
hospital okay obviously peachy has had

430
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,229
some mental illness maybe the the the

431
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:00,539
experience that he had has made him go

432
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:03,659
slightly crazy and so the reporter does

433
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:05,279
the right thing sends him off to a

434
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,039
hospital and that is the last he ever

435
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:10,409
sees of him he never sees peachy ever

436
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,289
again and a couple of days later peachy

437
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,559
dies of heatstroke leaving no trace of

438
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:20,639
the bag with dravot's head inside so

439
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:23,759
apparently he keeps the head because

440
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,460
he's crazy I don't know why but when he

441
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,830
disappears when he dies the bag and the

442
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,259
head they disappear too that is very

443
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:34,080
mysterious but a very strange end to a

444
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,369
very strange strange story what do you

445
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:40,919
think everyone do you think that peachy

446
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,379
and drove oz punishment fit their crimes

447
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:47,299
why or why not Mike what do you think

448
00:20:47,299 --> 00:20:51,239
this is a hard question to answer but

449
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:53,519
I'd say I think the punishment was fair

450
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,339
because it's not right to trick local

451
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,799
people into thinking you're a god

452
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,880
but then again

453
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,650
know what the punishment should be for

454
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:05,950
that so you know I just don't don't

455
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,840
pretend to be a god I think that's

456
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,970
probably the best advice we can give you

457
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:13,030
yeah also if you fall down into a ravine

458
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:15,640
or off a rope bridge how does someone

459
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,970
retrieve your head good question

460
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,850
that's weird yeah anyways maybe when he

461
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:25,230
hit the ground it popped off okay

462
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,810
sounds plausible to me all right all

463
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,460
