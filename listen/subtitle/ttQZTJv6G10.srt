00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,050
so

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:28,320
[Music]

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
hi everyone this is karen welcome back

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,760
everybody this is shane

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,680
today we're looking at part two of

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,280
putting pen to paper

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,239
the history of ballpoint pens and the

9
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,079
vocabulary words are

10
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,280
crew crew the captain of the ship asked

11
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,079
the crew

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,520
to do their best responsible responsible

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,160
the teacher discovered that dennis was

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,199
responsible for the broken window

15
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,640
household household diane made a list of

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,079
all the household chores

17
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,640
that need to be done contribute

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,520
contribute

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,080
a heart problem contributed to the

20
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,600
singer's death

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,880
essential essential heat electricity and

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,840
hot water

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,720
are considered essential services so

24
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,840
we're still talking about

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,960
ballpoint pens right right so i guess

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,119
this guy bureau made a lot of

27
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,320
money from this invention right at first

28
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,439
basically um it was just in argentina

29
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,439
that's right and he was able to sell

30
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,840
some of it like a really big contract

31
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,280
was to the uk i think the royal navy

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,840
that's right or air force right and that

33
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,600
was a big thing but he's not really the

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,079
one who spread the ballpoint pen all

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:40,960
over the world

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,759
it was actually an american businessman

37
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,079
right

38
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,320
go america milton reynolds i remember

39
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,960
his name is

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,960
right but i think one thing about the

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,560
ballpoint pen is that

42
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,439
it's kind of responsible for the curse

43
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:56,719
of writing

44
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,280
going out of fashion what do you mean

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,640
because when you write with a fountain

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,320
pen it's very easy to connect the

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,360
letters

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,240
together but with the ballpoint pen it's

49
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,719
not

50
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,520
quite as easy and so i think people

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,280
started to print and use like block

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,840
letters

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
more instead of cursive writing yeah

54
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,000
what a pity because i

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,800
love cursive writing it is really pretty

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,599
but yes but

57
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
i like nowadays i don't really see

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,959
anybody writing

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,400
in cursive writing yeah i wonder if

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
they're still teaching it in school

61
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,239
in like you know english-speaking

62
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,640
countries if it's important anymore but

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
i learned it and you learned it

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,920
yeah and i love it even until today i

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,000
still do it okay

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,560
well hopefully you learned a little bit

67
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
about the ballpoint pen

68
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,000
and learned a little bit about how sad

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
we are that handwriting or cursive

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,120
writing is out of fashion

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
okay enjoy today's lesson enjoy

72
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,519
putting pen to paper the history of

73
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,120
ballpoint pens

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,159
biro began selling his pen in argentina

75
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,000
where he and his brother had fled to

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,120
during world war ii his biggest customer

77
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,239
was the uk's

78
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,200
royal air force which ordered 30 000

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
pens to allow its crews

80
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,760
to write more easily while in the air

81
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,720
unfortunately

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,400
bureau wasn't able to spread his

83
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
invention around the world

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,120
instead american businessman milton

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,239
reynolds was the man

86
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,879
responsible for that after seeing the

87
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,319
pens in argentina

88
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,879
he changed the design just enough to

89
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,799
sell them as his own

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,200
though expensive the pens were a big hit

91
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,180
with american customers in the 1940s

92
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,239
[Music]

93
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,720
today's lesson is called putting pen to

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,480
paper the history

95
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,840
of ballpoint pens part two

96
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,879
hello everyone my name is jeff my name's

97
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,879
mike ballpoint pens they're everywhere

98
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,360
you probably have one around you right

99
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,760
now

100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,040
yesterday we learned about laszlo bureau

101
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,680
not a great scientist but a hungarian

102
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,640
journalist

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,439
who used old-fashioned fountain pens

104
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,040
leaked ink everywhere

105
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,519
got on his hands and all over the place

106
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,439
he thought there's got to be a better

107
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,959
way he saw some kids

108
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,439
rolling marbles through water he thought

109
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,959
if i could roll

110
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,160
ink across the page in the same way that

111
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,519
would make a good pen

112
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,280
he came up with the bulb that's what he

113
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,639
did well he and his brother and his

114
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,360
brother

115
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,800
they developed an ink but yes the ball

116
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,880
the marble rolling through the puddle

117
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,280
and making a line it gave me inspiration

118
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,560
for the ballpoint pen

119
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
and hungary it has been

120
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,000
invented yes and there's more to the

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,960
story

122
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,240
biro began selling his pen in

123
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,440
argentina where he and his

124
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,479
brother had fled to during

125
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,160
world war ii i'm sure there's a story

126
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,600
behind that

127
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
but let's go ahead and move on now his

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,400
biggest customer was the uk's

129
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,080
royal air force which ordered 30

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,720
000 pens to allow its crews to write

131
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,320
more easily while in the air

132
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,880
fascinating so there you go the royal

133
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,039
air force that's you know the the

134
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,160
the guys who fly warplanes around during

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,880
world war

136
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,840
ii the british royal air force or the uk

137
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
they ordered a bunch of these pens for

138
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,120
their crews

139
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,960
because those planes used to fly real

140
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,039
high it was cold up there

141
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,919
the old ink would just freeze inside the

142
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,479
pens

143
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,280
and the flight crews didn't want frozen

144
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:39,919
ink

145
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,320
in their pens what is a crew a crew is

146
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,199
basically a

147
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,600
team of workers working together

148
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,880
probably closely

149
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,600
for some special job we can talk about

150
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,880
the crew of a ship

151
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,039
the sailors and the officers the people

152
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,160
who run the ship

153
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,479
work the ship drive the ship fix the

154
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,319
ship that's the crew we could have a

155
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,240
film crew the people who do the lights

156
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,080
and the camera and the sound guy and the

157
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,199
makeup people

158
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,440
those are the film crew so they're all

159
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,280
working on a specific job

160
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,440
they all have different jobs but they

161
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
work as a

162
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,440
team for example the captain of the ship

163
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,720
asked the crew

164
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,960
to do their best do your best men and

165
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,240
they said yes sir

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
and they went off and did their best so

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,919
there you go so the air force

168
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,479
orders all these pins now

169
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:28,160
unfortunately beeru

170
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,479
wasn't able to spread his invention

171
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,360
around the world i just realized

172
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,120
something you know what british people

173
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,039
call ballpoint pens

174
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,600
what they call them biros spelt that way

175
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,400
interesting yeah that's why because the

176
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,000
royal air force ordered

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,599
them but still what's the story here

178
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,160
why was he not able to spread his

179
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,000
invention

180
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,240
throughout the world well the american

181
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,080
here's the story instead

182
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
it says that american businessman

183
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,479
milton reynolds was the man responsible

184
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,120
for that that's why americans don't call

185
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,240
them biros because of milton reynolds

186
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,880
milton reynolds what did he do what was

187
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
he responsible for

188
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,319
i bet he stole the idea he did he was

189
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:23,199
responsible for it

190
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,639
he did it he was behind

191
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,039
this by the way yes if you are

192
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,479
responsible

193
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,680
for something you

194
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,199
had a hand in that or in bringing

195
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,400
that thing about you did it you

196
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,000
caused it you were behind no

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,639
we're not talking about being

198
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:47,520
responsible people

199
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,800
oh you can trust me i'm responsible

200
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,680
no here we're kind of pointing a finger

201
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,319
as far as

202
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,440
guilt is concerned anyways for example

203
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,039
the teacher discovered that dennis

204
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,720
was responsible for the broken window

205
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
they don't call him dennis the menace

206
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,240
for nothing

207
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,039
anyways after seeing the pens in

208
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,639
argentina

209
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,280
he changed the design just enough

210
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,120
to sell him as his own oh so he stole

211
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,440
the

212
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,000
iphone and called it an e-phone and

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,080
changed the screen a little bit and made

214
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
a lot of money

215
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,919
that kind of idea oh that's terrible

216
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,680
well though expensive

217
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,640
the pens were a big hit with american

218
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,519
customers

219
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,799
in the 1940s let's take a break and then

220
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,320
we'll be back with more about

221
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,959
the ballpoint pen or the biro hello

222
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,880
again

223
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,720
putting pen to paper the history of

224
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,320
ballpoint pens

225
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,040
eventually mass production made plastic

226
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,279
ballpoint pens more affordable

227
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,560
and soon they were a household staple

228
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,880
although ballpoint pens were convenient

229
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,519
they changed the way that people write

230
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,680
because of the way the ink flows it

231
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,920
doesn't feel natural to join letters

232
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,040
together

233
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,360
in addition ballpoint pens can be less

234
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,880
comfortable to write with

235
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,720
because more pressure must be applied

236
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,399
when writing with them

237
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,560
some say these factors contributed to

238
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,690
the decline of cursive writing

239
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:19,040
[Music]

240
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
okay we're talking about ball point

241
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,519
pens now right before the break it said

242
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:25,839
that

243
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,440
in america there ballpoint pens were

244
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,120
kind of popular but they were also

245
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,279
kind of expensive but eventually

246
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,200
mass production made plastic

247
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,240
ballpoint pens more affordable

248
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,920
and soon they were a household

249
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,839
staple translation eventually

250
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,399
there were factories people learned how

251
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,120
to make

252
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,360
these pens by the boatload

253
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,560
out of plastic they became cheap and

254
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,680
then they were

255
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,720
everywhere they became household staples

256
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,519
absolutely a household is basically your

257
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,240
home

258
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,560
and the things and often the people

259
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
inside it all right so that is your

260
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,600
household

261
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,600
you have things in your household people

262
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
live in your household

263
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,880
furniture machines food you pay taxes on

264
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,200
your household and all sorts of stuff so

265
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,639
we're not just talking about the

266
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,440
building

267
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,519
we're talking about the place you live

268
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,760
if it's an apartment if it's a house

269
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,000
doesn't matter and the things and

270
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,600
activities and people

271
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
that are all involved in it that is your

272
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
household for example

273
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,399
diane made a list of all the household

274
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,360
chores

275
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,000
that need to be done cleaning washing

276
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,519
paying the bills

277
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,760
cooking all of these things might be

278
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,720
household

279
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
chores so a household staple is

280
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
something every home will have

281
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,440
every home will have ballpoint pens not

282
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,279
just rich people or whatever because

283
00:12:59,279 --> 00:12:59,920
they're so

284
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,800
cheap and easy to get although ballpoint

285
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,959
pens were convenient

286
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,240
they change the way that people write

287
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,920
very interesting so they were very

288
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,360
useful cheap

289
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,200
people used them so much that it

290
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,920
actually changed the way human beings

291
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,639
write their words why is that because of

292
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,639
the way the ink flows

293
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,760
it doesn't feel natural to join letters

294
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,519
together that was the old style of

295
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,160
writing

296
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
right cursive writing yeah you would

297
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,000
join all your letters together

298
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,200
in a flowing kind of way yeah and

299
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,120
in addition ballpoint pens can be

300
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,399
less comfortable to write with

301
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,320
because more pressure must be applied

302
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,079
when writing with them so push down here

303
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:48,760
are some

304
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,839
drawbacks okay now some say

305
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,880
these factors contributed

306
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,680
to the decline of cursive writing

307
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,120
i learned to write cursive i don't

308
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,680
write in cursive i would say that

309
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,720
texting probably is going to

310
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,760
lead to the decline of cursive writing

311
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,560
but that's a different topic for a

312
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,440
different

313
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,480
day here we have the verb contribute if

314
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,199
something

315
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,399
contributes to something in this case

316
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,240
it leads to that thing or it has a hand

317
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,639
in that thing so some people think the

318
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,079
ballpoint pen

319
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,199
it's everywhere people use them all

320
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,920
over the place and because of certain

321
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,199
drawbacks to the

322
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,480
ballpoint pen i should say that maybe

323
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:40,959
people

324
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,760
don't write in cursive as much as they

325
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,399
used to

326
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,399
they write those block letters where all

327
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,760
the letters are separate

328
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,639
that's what i do anyways for example a

329
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,120
hard

330
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,240
problem contributed to the

331
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,519
singer's death not a ballpoint pen

332
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,680
no it was a heart problem he was smoking

333
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,360
too much and just

334
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,839
had a heart attack anyways folks with

335
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,839
that it's time for us to take a break

336
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:06,639
but don't

337
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,560
go away we'll be back soon

338
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,079
it doesn't feel natural to maintain

339
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:20,799
physical

340
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,120
distance from our loved ones

341
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,280
on

342
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,840
putting pen to paper the history of

343
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,440
ballpoint pens

344
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,600
ballpoint pens have become an essential

345
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,919
tool in our everyday lives

346
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,679
who would have thought that this amazing

347
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,200
invention was inspired

348
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,360
by something as simple as children

349
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,400
playing with marbles

350
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,200
okay folks let's start wrapping things

351
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,160
up

352
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,679
ball point pens have become an

353
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,320
essential tool in our everyday

354
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,080
lives we can't do without them

355
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,840
if we didn't have ballpoint pens we'd

356
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,919
have to write with pencils or

357
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,960
markers or feather quills

358
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,000
quills or fountain pens or

359
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,679
crayons right oh gosh the list goes on

360
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,400
and on yeah

361
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,280
absolutely that's why ballpoint pens are

362
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,400
essential they're

363
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,039
necessary if you want to write easily

364
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,559
and you don't want to spend a lot of

365
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,919
money or make a lot of

366
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,120
mess the ballpoint pen is what you need

367
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,799
and if something is essential

368
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,520
this adjective just says it's necessary

369
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,000
it's

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,799
needed you can't really do this thing

371
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:47,679
without it

372
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,240
or if you tried it would be a lot more

373
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,880
difficult

374
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,960
for example if you want to travel to

375
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,320
another country

376
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,919
a passport is essential you can't get

377
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,760
into a foreign country

378
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,080
without a passport unless you're the

379
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,400
queen of england or something like that

380
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,080
now if something is essential it just

381
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,679
means we need it it's

382
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,120
very very important or even absolutely

383

needed in our lives for example heat

a tent in the forest

393
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,320
because you won't have any of that stuff

394
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
but for most buildings

395
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
it's absolutely essential and who

396
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,559

397
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,600
invention was

398
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,720
inspired by something as simple as

399
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,160
children playing with
