everybody i'm shane

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,440
today we have our lesson on closed test

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,559
and it's called

8
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,000
cyberspace in space and the vocabulary

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,719
words are

10
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,840
mankind mankind the history of mankind

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,120
is full of war and violence agency

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,239
agency after she got her degree colleen

13
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,440
started working for a government agency

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,600
lunar luna the moon takes 27.3 days to

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,280
go once around the earth

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,160
and complete a full lunar cycle

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:00,879
partnership

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,280
partnership experts agree that the

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,680
partnership between the two companies

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,720
has been quite successful so we're

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,840
talking about something really

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,400
interesting cyber space in space

23
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,080
yes because if you go to the moon

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,240
right and you get off of your rocket

25
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,600
what is the first thing you want to do

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,479
selfie right and then

27
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,000
post it to instagram right so

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,360
what would happen if people can't do

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,119
that that's pretty horrible so that's

30
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,799
where nokia is going to help

31
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,600
right so nasa is going to put another

32
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,840
they hope by

33
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,759
2024 that's right to have the next man

34
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
and the first woman on the surface of

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,759
the moon

36
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,840
that is so cool so of course they're

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,479
going to want to be checking their ig

38
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,360
you know so we have to set up some kind

39
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:53,680
of

40
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,719
cellular network so they're really going

41
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,360
to do it

42
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,840
so that means in the future if let's say

43
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,439
if we go to the moon

44
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,600
then we'll be able to take selfies and

45
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,640
post it on

46
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,240
you know our whatever social social

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,000
media yeah that we want to yeah

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,840
like instantly but it's also going to be

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,080
important for communication between the

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,800
people

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,000
it's not just for selfies on instagram

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,560
that's true it could check the health

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,280
status of the astronauts and things like

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,160
that so

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,319
of course there are some real practical

56
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,000
and important reasons

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,920
it's not just for social media you are

58
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
right okay i'm so sorry

59
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
but it's a wonderful progress let's

60
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,840
learn more about cyberspace

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,840
in space let's go

62
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,800
cyberspace in space in 1969

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,440
nasa helped mankind make history by

64
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,519
putting a man on the moon

65
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,160

make some tech breakthroughs

83
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,280
think about this

84
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,360

make history by putting a man on the

99
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,880

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,680
recently anyway mankind

103
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,960
is a word that you can use to refer to

104
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,400
all people or all

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,960
of humanity or all of the human race

106
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,080
at once basically the term

107
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,919
mankind refers to the human species

108
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,600
as a whole for example the history of

109
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,639
mankind

110
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,919
is full of war

111
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,479
and violence well all of that

112
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,479
happened in 1969 in the past

113
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,919
now nasa is once again

114
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,720
break new ground by bringing the moon

115
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319

on

120
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
how

121
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,960
so the sentence should read now

122
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,479
nasa is once again looking

123
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,960
to break new ground by bringing the moon

124
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,720
online there you have it nasa is

125
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,160
taking us back to the moon but first

126
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,120
they are going to bring the moon online

127
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
it's official

128
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,599
to bring the moon online well

129
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,639
but they will have some help

130
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,759
right the space agency

131
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,120
has teamed up with the finnish

132
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,120
phone company nokia on this project

133
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,639
and together they aim to have the lunar

134
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,360
surface by 2022

135
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,560
your options are a wire be

136
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,550
wired c wiring

137
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,639
[Music]

138
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,160
so the sentence should read

139
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,080
the space agency has teamed up with the

140
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
finnish phone company nokia

141
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,720
on this project and together they

142
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,920
aim to have the lunar surface wired

143
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,160
by 2022 okay we have

144
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,360
two vocabulary words to discuss

145
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,880
the first of these is the word agency

146
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,079
an agency is like a company or an

147
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,120
organization

148
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,399
that focuses on or specializes

149
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,240
in one thing travel agencies help people

150
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,519
travel while a space agency might help

151
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,079
people

152
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,279
to go to space and beyond

153
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,040
for example after she got her degree

154
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,839
colleen started working for a government

155
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,519
agency

156
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,120
also we have the adjective lunar

157
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,480
to talk about the word lunar means of

158
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,160
or having to do with the moon

159
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,279
okay now if you wanted to talk about the

160
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,880
sun there's a related adjective

161
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,480
solar solar means of or having to do

162
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,440
with

163
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,360
the sun okay i know this sounds

164
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,800
weird these adjectives come from

165
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,600
latin so don't worry about it too much

166
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,720
for example

167
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,959
the moon takes 27

168
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,560
days to go once around the earth

169
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,480
and complete a full lunar

170
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,160
cycle okay everyone with that it is now

171
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,560
time for a break but don't go away

172
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,200
we'll be back after a short break

173
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,040
cyberspace in space the partnership is

174
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,279
part of nasa's artemis program

175
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,360
which plans to put the first woman and

176
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,399
the next man on the moon by the year

177
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,120
2024

178
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,399
nokia was given 14.1 million dollars to

179
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,959
design

180
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,320
a 4g lte network that will be upgraded

181
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,380
to 5g in the future

182
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,639

cyberspace in space

187
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,200
well before the break we learned that we

188
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,600

189
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,959

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,200
nasa is going back to the moon but

194
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,800
they're also going to do some really

195
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,399
cool stuff while they're there nasa

196
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,399
is going to go back to the moon

197
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,600
and they're also going to bring the moon

198
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,040
online does this mean that there will be

199
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,399
internet on the moon well i guess

200
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,399
that's possible it is possible

201
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,760
yes nasa is going to bring the moon

202
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,600
online so

203
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,360
internet on the moon it's a possibility

204
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,000
but

205
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,399
they're not doing all of this alone nasa

206
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,680
is working with a

207
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,880
finnish company named nokia to bring the

208
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,600
moon

209
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,279
online and the partnership is part of

210
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,560
nasa's artemis program which plans to

211
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,920
put the first woman

2024

214
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,920

215
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,440
word of the day

216
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,519

etc for example experts agreed that the

221
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,120
partnership

222
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,079
between the two companies has been quite

223
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,839
successful

224
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,519
wow all of this surely

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,440
enough it sounds like there will be a

233
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,639
cellular network there on the moon

234
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,680

no joke she's serious

268
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,759
everyone nasa and nokia

269
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,800
are working together to build a

270
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,240
cellular network on

271
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,079
the moon it will be a

272
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,839
4g network that can be upgraded to a

273
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
5g network in the future

274
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,600
wow ok let's read on the lunar network

275
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,919
will provide new visitors to the moon

276
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,880
every mobile convenience they already

277
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,439

278
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,880
on earth your options are a

279
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,240
2 b by c

280
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,559
4

281
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,600
so the sentence should read the lunar

282
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,320
network

283
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,120
will provide new visitors to the moon

284
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,520
with

285
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,799
every mobile convenience they already

286
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,520
have

287
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,799
on earth so yes

288
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,840
if you are lucky enough to be one of the

289
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,640
visitors

290
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,919
to the moon and rich enough yeah one of

291
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,280
those rich people

292
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,039
if you're one of these people lucky

293
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,440
enough to get to the moon in the near

294
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
future

295
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,080
you'll be able to log on to the internet

296
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,640
while on the moon

297
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,760
you will be able to use your smartphone

298
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,960
while on the moon yep and there's

299
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,000
more astronauts will be able to

300
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,120
communicate

301
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,640
and share data with one another and also

302
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,559
use it for navigation

303
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,360
beats

304
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,520
so yes it will be great for smartphone

305
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,320
usage

306
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,640
but it will also be useful for people

307
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,640
like astronauts who will have a

308
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,200
real need for it while on the moon

309
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,400
blank it will be used

310
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,240
to track each astronaut's health

311
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,720
and fitness your options are a

312
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,400
personally be fortunately

313
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,520
c strange to say

314
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,640
or d

315
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,159
so the sentence should read what's more

316
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,200
it will be used to track each

317
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,799
astronaut's health and fitness

318
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,240
anyway i know that that might

319
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,000
sound boring but astronauts will be

320
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,360
the people who first go back

321
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,559
to the moon and it will most

322
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,840
likely be astronauts who are there

323
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,960
most often so we should probably take

324
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,440
good

325
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,559
care of them right but if

326
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,280
everything goes according to plan

327
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,720
instagram stories

328
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,600
straight from the moon can't be far

329
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,559
behind

330
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,240
it's true

331
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,720
it's so true yeah anyway everyone we are

332
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,120
now

333
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,799
finished yes our lesson is now

334
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,200
