00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,329
[Music]

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
so

3
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:28,240
[Music]

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,320
hi everyone this is karen welcome back

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,120
everybody surprise surprise it's shane

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,880
today we're looking at part two of

7
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,200
surprising geography facts

8
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,160
and the vocabulary words are exposed

9
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,040
exposed

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,120
the fire was caused by an exposed wire

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,239
vanish vanish the plane flew high into

12
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,039
the sky

13
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,239
and then vanished above the clouds

14
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,600
damn damn a dam was built to help

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,800
control flooding in

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,399
areas near the river process process

17
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,039
i only eat food that has not been

18
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:03,840
processed

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,360
in any way roughly roughly

20
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,920
roughly half of my neighborhood lost

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,560
power

22
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,000
after the storm so we are talking about

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,840
surprising geography

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,560
facts right right they start with the

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,119
dead

26
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:22,799
sea yeah that's right what a scary name

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,200
i know but it's going to vanish it's

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
going to disappear before our

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,400
eyes because of the rising sea level

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,200
right

31
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,159
and it has like the the lowest exposed

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,880
point of

33
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,600
earth because it's actually below sea

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,240
level

35
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,400
that's right that's interesting right

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,439
very low

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,240
and then another surprising geography

38
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,360
fact is that

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
did you know the world's tallest

40
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,439
mountain is not

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,479
mount everest that's right it's actually

42
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,600
in hawaii right that's crazy yeah it's

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,320
because

44
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
that the base of the mountain yes

45
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,079
because hawaii is an island

46
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
right so actually the base of the

47
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,240
mountain is below sea level

48
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,880
so if you are to measure from the base

49
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
of the mountain to the top it's

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,360
higher higher than mount everest i

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,640
didn't know that i've always thought

52
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,120
mount everest is the tallest mountain

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,959
in the world i think the most

54
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,480
interesting one is that

55
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,400
australia is wider than the moon

56
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,599
i know i didn't know that because from

57
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,080
my

58
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,480
east side to the west side it's about 4

59
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,400
000 kilometers wide

60
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,200
but the moon is only about i think 3 and

61
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
400

62
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,160
kilometers wide wow that is so amazing

63
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,040
yeah yeah that's what's fun about

64
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,640
learning these kind of facts because

65
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,360
they're just so

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,920
fascinating and interesting i know and

67
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,280
you can tell people about them and

68
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:47,680
they'll be

69
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,959
wow you're so smart impress

70
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,800
people by your english and your

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,239
knowledge of geography

72
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,680
you are definitely right and you're

73
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,000
welcome

74
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
surprising geography facts the dead sea

75
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,080
is below sea level and sinking

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,239
the dead sea has the lowest exposed

77
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,360
point on land

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,280
at 430.5 meters below sea level

79
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,000
however it is vanishing right before our

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,959
eyes

81
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,599
once covering an area of almost 1 000

82
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,959
square kilometers

83
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,480
it now only reaches around 650.

84
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,120
humans are to blame for this dams were

85
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,040
built which prevent the flow of water

86
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,080
into the lake

87
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,959
and factories pump water out to process

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:35,760
minerals

89
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,040
lowering the water level

90
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,480
today's lesson is called surprising

91
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,599
geography facts part two

92
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,239
hello everyone my name is jeff and i'm

93
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,480
mike and we're learning some amazing

94
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,280
and interesting facts about the world

95
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,560
antarctica

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,959
is the world's biggest desert and did

97
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,239
you know that russia

98
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,519
is like really big i knew that but i

99
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,319
didn't know that

100
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,680
11 times i didn't well i didn't know it

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,560
covered 11

102
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,799
time zones and it also controls an

103
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,879
island that is on one side

104
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,120
of the international date line

105
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,160
separating the

106
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,880
world into 24 hours and just four

107
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,918
kilometers away

108
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,560
on the other side of that line is an

109
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
american island so it's one day

110
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,840
in russia it's the day before in america

111
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,560
amazing

112
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,520
incredible okay let's move on and talk

113
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,720
about

114
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,440
the dead sea a fascinating body of water

115
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,880
the dead sea

116
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,040
is below sea level

117
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,160
and sinking and sinking

118
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,320
it's actually getting lower the body of

119
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,680
water itself is

120
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,280
getting lower and lower does that mean

121
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,759
that it's

122
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,479
drying out or does it mean that the body

123
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,840
of water itself is

124
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,360
actually like sinking into the earth

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,520
probably a little bit of both but it's

126
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,240
definitely drying out yeah the dead sea

127
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,199
which is there

128
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,440
in the eastern part of israel near i

129
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,360
think between israel and jordan

130
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,199
it has the lowest exposed point on land

131
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,720
at 430.5 meters

132
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,280
below sea level so if you're gonna walk

133
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,520
over to the mediterranean sea

134
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,680
which is the closest big sea you'd

135
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,639
actually be going

136
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,759
uphill you'd be going up to get there so

137
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,759
the dead sea like death valley in

138
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,120
america is also

139
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,000
below sea level that's not that unusual

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,880
however

141
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,440
it is vanishing the dead sea is also

142
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
vanishing

143
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,600
right before our eyes like the aerial

144
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,639
sea

145
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,880
like a lot of glaciers i think global

146
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,360
warming and human activity might be to

147
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,240
blame here

148
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,199
we're the worst aren't we anyways here

149
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,360
we have this word exposed

150
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,800
to talk about if something is exposed

151
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,000
it's kind of out in the open okay that's

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,840
all there is to it in this particular

153
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,880
situation

154
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,840
in other situations if someone is

155
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,880
exposed

156
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,360
they're open and unprotected and

157
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
vulnerable but here

158
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,520
we're saying that this is out in the

159
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
open okay this point

160
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,919
it's there it's out in the open if you

161
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:20,880
wanted to

162
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,840
you could go there and touch it or

163
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,479
something

164
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,680
it's there it's exposed for example the

165
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,240
fire was caused by

166
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,080
an exposed wire someone probably

167
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
should have done something about it

168
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
maybe closed

169
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,880
that up that wire shouldn't have been

170
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,360
exposed or

171
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
it shouldn't have been unprotected

172
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,560
someone should have

173
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,280
someone should have protected that wire

174
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,080
i should say

175
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,319
yeah we cover wires with plastic or

176
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,319
rubber right because if it's exposed and

177
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,199
you touch it

178
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,680
or another wire touches it it can cause

179
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,160
a spark or a fire or something bad all

180
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,599
right we also have this word

181
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,400
vanish when something vanishes it does

182
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,639
that it disappears it was there

183
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,520
and then a second later maybe it's not

184
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,680
there anymore i mean we often think of a

185
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,720
magician

186
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,479
with some kind of egg or something and

187
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:13,840
then they do this and oh

188
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,199
it's gone it's vanished it's disappeared

189
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,599
that's magic alright now sometimes

190
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,759
things vanish or disappear

191
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,080
it's not magic if you leave your cell

192
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,360
phone on a table

193
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,680
in a public place and walk away for two

194
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
minutes you might come back and go

195
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,639
it's vanished that wasn't magic someone

196
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,280
probably

197
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,000
took it away and stole it or something

198
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,039
like that and

199
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,759
things can vanish or disappear slowly

200
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:40,160
too

201
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,720
it doesn't always happen like that for

202
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,360
example

203
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,759
a rain puddle right rain will fall and

204
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,000
then the sun comes out and the heat will

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,639
make that

206
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,960
little puddle that little bit of water

207
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,680
vanish

208
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,240
or disappear it wasn't magic it didn't

209
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,280
happen quickly

210
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,080
but it was there and then later on it

211
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,800
wasn't there

212
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,960
as if it was never there in the first

213
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,319
place for example

214
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,440
the plane flew high into the sky and

215
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:05,759
then

216
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,639
vanished above the clouds it's still

217
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:09,039
there

218
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,199
you just can't see it there you go

219
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,720
that's the idea so how

220
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,680
is the dead sea vanishing well we'll

221
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,199
learn more about that i think

222
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,080
okay we read on the next sentence says

223
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,520
once covering an

224
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,400
area of almost 1 000 square kilometers

225
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,800
it now only reaches around

226
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,279
650 so that's quite the reduction now

227
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,120
humans are to blame for this

228
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,200
we are the worst dams were built

229
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,240
which prevent the flow of water into the

230
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,959
lake

231
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,000
and factories pump water

232
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,519
out to process minerals lowering the

233
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,959
water level

234
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,399
also look up the arrow see

235
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,440
the same thing happened to the aerial

236
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,720
sea

237
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,040
anyways here let's talk about the word

238
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,839
damn

239
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,040
a dam is kind of like a wall

240
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
for water it's a wall that directs

241
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,920
water keeps it in one place keep float

242
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
or keeps it flowing in one direction

243
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,680
uh it might produce hydro electric power

244
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,120
etc that's what dams do for example

245
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,800
a dam was built to help control flooding

246
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,399
in areas near the river some famous

247
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,000
dams in the world uh who the hoover dam

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,600
in the united states and the three

249
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,240
gorges dam in china yeah and they have

250
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,480
some smaller dams here i think in taiwan

251
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,360
i believe so yeah

252
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
up in the mountains they help to control

253
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,880
water and also sometimes

254
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,200
make power so they've damned the river

255
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
basically stopping the rivers

256
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,680
that used to flow into the water into

257
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,320
the lake

258
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,800
or into the dead sea of course that will

259
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,480
make the water levels go down and

260
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,200
they're also

261
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,839
taking the water that's in there out

262
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:00,240
they're

263
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,880
pumping the water out and using it in

264
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,600
factories and other places like that to

265
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,800
process

266
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,600
different things to process things is to

267
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,160
change

268
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,120
things through some kind of mechanical

269
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
industrial

270
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,720
engineering thing all right so a factory

271
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,240
will take the water in

272
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,399
and then use that water to polish steel

273
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,000
make cat food produce clothing who knows

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
well i think you must need water to

275
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
produce cat food i don't know

276
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,000
but they use it in order to do something

277
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,120
it's basically

278
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,120
one of the ingredients that goes into

279
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
this factory method

280
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,519
in order to produce something in the end

281
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,519
maybe nothing to do with water like

282
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,440
cat food or clothes i think clothing

283
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
production they have to use a lot of

284
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,120
water in the production or the

285
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,079
processing

286
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,399
of cotton and other things like that so

287
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,320
the water goes to do something

288
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,560
and doesn't go to the dead sea nope

289
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,079
doesn't go to the dead sea it goes into

290
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,600
the factory they use it up

291
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,519
and then it ends up in the in the in the

292
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,079
drain or you know going down the sewer

293
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,480
that kind of thing not in the dead sea

294
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,079
where of course it should be

295
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,279
for example i only eat food

296
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,200
that has not been processed in any way

297
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,120
alright so if you're eating fresh

298
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,000
vegetables those have not been processed

299
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,519
if you're eating vegetables that are

300
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,360
frozen or in a can

301
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,920
or made into some kind of microwave food

302
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,320
that you cook very quickly at home

303
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,480
those types of vegetables have been

304
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,240
processed something has been done to

305
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,880
them

306
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,360
in a factory in some way let's take a

307
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,120
break and then we'll be back with more

308
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,360
amazing geography facts

309
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
hello

310
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,120
he quickly pumped the water out of the

311
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,680
boat

312
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,199
to prevent it from sinking

313
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
down

314
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,440
can help lower blood pressure

315
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,399
surprising geography facts the world's

316
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,600
tallest mountain

317
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,040
is in hawaii mount everest is known for

318
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,519
having the highest peak above sea level

319
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,600
but it's not actually the tallest

320
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,959
mountain on earth

321
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,839
no that distinction belongs to hawaii's

322
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,880
mauna kea

323
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,959
which stands ten thousand two hundred

324
00:15:58,959 --> 00:15:59,920
meters high

325
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,000
when it is measured from its undersea

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,040
base to its top

327
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,839
okay next we're going to talk about the

328
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,560
world's

329
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
tallest mountain which duh

330
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,800
is mount everest right

331
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,600
wrong the world's tallest mountain

332
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
is in hawaii

333
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,480
hawaii hawaii those beautiful islands in

334
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,199
the middle of the

335
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,279
i mean i know they have volcanoes there

336
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,600
they are volcanoes yeah exactly but

337
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,240
a big tall mountain no that doesn't make

338
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,320
any sense well it depends

339
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,880
how you look at it what are you calling

340
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,519
a

341
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,680
mountain it says on sea level it does

342
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,959
depend on sea level

343
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,600
mount everest is known for having the

344
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,040
highest peak

345
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,560
above sea level so if you want to get up

346
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,920
near the clouds

347
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,959
mount everest is the place to go but

348
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,440
if you're looking for just a big pile of

349
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,720
rock that you can go

350
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,279
from the bottom to the top of mount

351
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,959
everest in it baby

352
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,760
but it's not actually the tallest

353
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,480
mountain

354
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,760
on earth no mike if you're looking for

355
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,839
the biggest or tallest mountain i should

356
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,160
say

357
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,520
from base to peak well

358
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,000
you shouldn't look to mount everest no

359
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,760
that distinction belongs to hawaii's

360
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,199
mauna kea which stands ten thousand two

361
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,640
hundred meters high

362
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,600
when it is measured from its undersea

363
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,480
base

364
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,520
to its top how about that okay everyone

365
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,160
with that

366
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,919
with that it's time for us to take a

367
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,200
break but don't go away

368
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:47,840
we'll be right back after this

369
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,400
surprising geography facts australia

370
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,520
is wider than the moon the continent of

371
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,320
australia

372
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,200
is roughly 4 000 kilometers from east to

373
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,000
west

374
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,960
while the moon is only 3 400 kilometers

375
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,919
across

376
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,240
this makes australia wider than the moon

377
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,440
itself

378
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,799
it may be over 4.5 billion years old

379
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,679
but the earth can still surprise us it

380
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:56,000
just

381
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,400
goes to show what an amazing planet we

382
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,370
live on

383
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,440
[Music]

384
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,480
okay everybody we

385
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,720
we've been waiting for this we haven't

386
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,440
talked about

387
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,039
australia yet so let's talk about

388
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:18,360
australia mates get this

389
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,520
australia is wider

390
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,600
than the moon australia is wider than

391
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,480
the moon i'm sorry my australian accent

392
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,480
is atrocious well i won't argue with

393
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
that but i won't argue either

394
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,200
with the fact that australia is wider is

395
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,039
bigger from side to side

396
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,039
than the moon is yeah it's true the

397
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,720
continent of australia

398
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,880
is big well we know that but actually

399
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
the sentence says

400
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,200
the continent of australia is roughly

401
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,240
4 000 kilometers from east

402
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,880
to west if you drove across the country

403
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,600
you would be driving approximately 4 000

404
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,400
kilometers

405
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,200
in a straight line while the moon while

406
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,480
the moon is only

407
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,799
3 400 kilometers across

408
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,559
600 kilometers less so there you go

409
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,280
yeah anyways here we have the adverb

410
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,720
roughly to talk about

411
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,919
here the word roughly means

412
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:18,880
approximately or

413
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,039
about is it exactly 4 000 kilometers

414
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,919
no we're estimating it's close for

415
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:26,880
example

416
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,679
roughly half of my neighborhood lost

417
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,720
power

418
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,840
after the storm did i go out there and

419
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,480
count

420
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,000
every single house and do the figures

421
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,880
no i looked out my window and it looked

422
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,840
like

423
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,960
about half of the neighborhood lost

424
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,760
power there you go okay let's go ahead

425
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,000
and

426
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,600
move on this makes australia

427
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,840
wider than the moon itself

428
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,080
amazing and there's more kangaroos in

429
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,919
australia too than on the moon

430
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,640
that's another great geography fact

431
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,840
anyway let's move on

432
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,400
it may be over 4.5 billion years old

433
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,440
but the earth can still surprise us

434
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,880
that's right most of us

435
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,520
have gone through geography class many

436
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:18,320
maybe many years of geography class

437
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
but today in our two articles we've

438
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
learned a few facts that i'm sure

439
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,360
not every single one of you knew all of

440
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,640
these facts so the

441
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,840
earth is old but it's still amazing it

442
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,280
just goes to show

443
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,400
what an amazing planet we live on

444
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,159
with big continents cold deserts

445
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,440
tiny islands on different days it's it's

446
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,159
incredible

447
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,919
and there are mountains that you can't

448
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,760
really climb because most of them are

449
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,400
underwater

450
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
and there are also more kangaroos here

451
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,480
than on the moon that's another amazing

452
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,679
fact isn't it wow

453
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,320
yeah wow yeah and koala was mind-blowing

454
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,159
all right here we've got a question

455
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,000
we've got to ask and answer

456
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,360
the rethink question do you

457
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,400
know any other geography

458
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,120
fun facts that weren't mentioned in the

459
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,000
article

460
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,960
and if you don't which fact did you find

461
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,600
the most

462
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,320
interesting and why and you can't use

463
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,840
the fact that there are more

464
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,960
kangaroos in australia than on the moon

465
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,039
oh i don't know that's a pretty good

466
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,840
fact no it's not

467
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,640
all right trivially like best well all

468
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,039
right

469
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,520
i know i know that there are certain

470
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,480
places and i

471
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,360
believe in canada the bay of fundy is

472
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,120
one of them where the tides are

473
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,240
so high they can come up 20 or 30

474
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,520
feet and rivers can flow backwards

475
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,880
rivers flow uphill that's a pretty cool

476
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,200
fact

477
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,640
i've seen it happen it's true really

478
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,159
you've seen it okay families from that

479
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,919
area oh nice nice

480
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,760
anyways folks with that it's time for us

481
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,919
to end our lesson and to say

482
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,080
bye bye take care come on

approximately a-p-p-r-o-x-i-m-a-t-e-l-y

485
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,679
it goes to show that with hard work

486
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:26,320
anything

487
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,200
