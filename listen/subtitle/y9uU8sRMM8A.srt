shame are you playing game yeah okay

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,810
today we're looking at part two of the

5
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,740
life of a pro gamer and the vocabulary

6
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,100
words are prevent prevent washing your

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,559
hands often can prevent the spread of

8
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,980
many diseases physical physical

9
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,530
although joe suffered no physical harm

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,160
in the accident the mental effects will

11
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,320
last a long time

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,780
frequent frequent periods of extreme

13
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,270
heat have become more frequent in recent

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:58,990
years retired retired alice wants to

15
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,210
move to the countryside after she

16
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,449
retires mmm-hmm advertising advertising

17
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:06,940
the company has increased its spending

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,930
on advertising over the past few months

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:12,190
well we're still talking about the

20
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:15,550
interesting life not a pro-gamer and we

21
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,990
don't know too much about right and we

22
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,820
learned that actually it takes a lot of

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,310
practice and i think even if you're not

24
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,710
a pro gamer and you spend a lot of time

25
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:26,440
using your hand and sitting in a chair

26
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:31,179
you it's easy to get a sore back or sore

27
00:01:31,179 --> 00:01:33,610
hands and fingers and that is why these

28
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,190
pro gamers they would have to take these

29
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,770
breaks where there was stand up and do

30
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,289
some stretches and do some exercise

31
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,970
that's almost like being an athlete

32
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:46,420
before you perform or before you do some

33
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,520
type of sports you need to stretch your

34
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,920
muscles to make sure you don't hurt your

35
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,050
self during good position right you're

36
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:56,289
good okay and also your eyes will get

37
00:01:56,289 --> 00:01:58,569
really really tired from staring at the

38
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:02,080
screen all the time unnoticed even using

39
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,340
my smartphone

40
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,319
yes my hands will start to get tired

41
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,020
from holding the phone and typhoons and

42
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,419
just keep you know looking at my phone

43
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:14,260
swiping my phone so i can imagine being

44
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,590
on a playing a video game for 15 hours a

45
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,920
day that's why these short breaks are so

46
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,950
important to these pro gamers and the

47
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,380
lifespan of their career is actually not

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,540
that long by the time people are

49
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,510
graduating college you know 22 23 this

50
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:31,990
game

51
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,510
are already retiring from their pro

52
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,970
career so what would they do afterwards

53
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:40,090
make youtube videos there's a lot of

54
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,470
videos where people like to see a

55
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:44,260
walkthrough or a review of a video game

56
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,390
and they can make advertising money from

57
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,190
that type of thing yeah right well maybe

58
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,520
do some coach coaching you write

59
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,300
interesting so if you're really

60
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,550
interested you have to be serious it's

61
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,490
not all fun and games and you have to be

62
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,160
very dedicated that's right okay right

63
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:07,090
for more about pro gamers the life of a

64
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,020
pro gamer

65
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,720
even though pro gamers spend most of

66
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,850
their time sitting down they still need

67
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,860
training to prevent physical injuries

68
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,500
they have to stretch between matches to

69
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,810
prevent injury to their wrists arms or

70
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,000
shoulders they also need to take

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,010
frequent breaks from looking at screens

72
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,710
to prevent eye strain additionally while

73
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,810
gamers are known for all-night sessions

74
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,910
it's important for them to get enough

75
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,610
sleep maintaining a healthy schedule

76
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,680
makes a gamer more disciplined which

77
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,840
translates into better performance in

78
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,470
the game as well

79
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,270
welcome everyone today's lesson is

80
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,540
called the life of a pro gamer part 2

81
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,599
hello everyone my name is Jeff and I'm

82
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,489
Mike yeah we're learning what it would

83
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:55,980
be like to be a professional video or

84
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,620
computer game player yeah you've seen

85
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,420
these people on TV you might have

86
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,220
watched a show about them or maybe you

87
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,890
enjoy watching them play online on

88
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,720
Twitch or something like that but what's

89
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,209
it really like well yesterday we learned

90
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:11,700
that it's actually really hard you might

91
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,640
be playing video games 50 60 70 hours a

92
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,470
day 15 hours uh sorry a week 15 hours a

93
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,590
day little time for a personal life or

94
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,930
even sleeping and things like that but

95
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:28,710
big prizes big salaries million-dollar

96
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:31,470
cash prizes if you win tournaments the

97
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,540
attraction is obvious and you're doing

98
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,790
something you love too but when you're

99
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,669
doing this you're also sitting down a

100
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,010
lot of times is true and they do say

101
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,130
that sitting down okay is extremely bad

102
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:46,530
for you okay so if you're a pro gamer

103
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,300
you're gonna be spending a lot of your

104
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,430
time sitting down so you're gonna have

105
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,560
to do something to counteract the

106
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,419
effects of sitting down all the time

107
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,090
yeah even though pro gamers spend most

108
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:59,640
of their time sitting down they still

109
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,789
lead a training I should say to prevent

110
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:04,590
physical injuries so the training will

111
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,840
be physical and the whole idea is that

112
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,820
they don't hurt their bodies that they

113
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,640
don't get physical injuries yeah now of

114
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,950
course all athletes do a lot to prevent

115
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,650
injuries it will definitely not be good

116
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,900
for the athlete because if you prevent

117
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,030
something this verb means you stop

118
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,460
something from happening by taking

119
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,669
action before it happens you make sure

120
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,620
it doesn't happen by being smart and

121
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,530
preparing yourself by doing something in

122
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,600
advance alright so a lot of people

123
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,729
around the wintertime might wear masks

124
00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:38,039
to prevent themselves from catching a

125
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,800
cold or passing on a cold if they have

126
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,720
one another way to prevent sickness is

127
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,479
to wash your hands okay if you want to

128
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,130
prevent yourself from falling asleep

129
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,350
moon maybe drink a cup of coffee or

130
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:51,360
something to help your self wake up a

131
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,340
little bit we wear helmets when we ride

132
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,010
motorcycles and seatbelts and cars

133
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,190
to prevent being badly hurt should if

134
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,020
there is an accident or should there be

135
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,450
an accident so all of these things are

136
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,670
done to prevent something usually

137
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,890
something bad you wouldn't really want

138
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,690
to prevent someone from giving you a

139
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:11,550
birthday present because that's a good

140
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,200
thing yeah but you wouldn't want to

141
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,910
prevent someone from kicking you by

142
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,530
moving away from them because that's a

143
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,230
bad thing for exemple washing your hands

144
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,960
often can prevent the spread of many

145
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,890
diseases

146
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,020
yeah that's why doctors tell us to do it

147
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,320
birthday presents good kicks bad day

148
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,840
kicks bad got it I don't I don't want

149
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,810
anyone to hurt me with happy birthday

150
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,230
I don't want anyone to kick me because

151
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,660
that might hurt my body it might injure

152
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:43,140
me physically physically is the adverb

153
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,900
physical is the adjective okay yet

154
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,610
through physical training to prevent

155
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,790
physical injuries ie you have to

156
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,150
exercise your body so as to not hurt

157
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,460
your body yes the adjective physical

158
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,100
means of the body or relating to the

159
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,060
body and not the mind okay the word for

160
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,940
the mind would be mental the word for

161
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,160
the body is physical for example

162
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,980
although Joe suffered no physical harm

163
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,490
in the accident the mental effects will

164
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,850
last a long time so he survived but he

165
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:20,670
might just have experienced some trauma

166
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:22,950
so in his mind he might be hurt but his

167
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,830
body is fine anyways as far as these

168
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,590
pro-gamers are concerned they have to

169
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,230
stretch between matches to prevent

170
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,060
injury to their wrists arms or shoulders

171
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,160
they have to stretch stretch stretch all

172
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,250
the time so that they don't get hurt

173
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,230
playing a video game I know it sounds

174
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,540
funny but it can happen but if you've

175
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,180
ever sat at a desk for 15 hours yeah you

176
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,550
will notice your shoulders and other

177
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,710
parts your neck maybe will start to hurt

178
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,080
and of course their eyes because that's

179
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,550
what's doing a lot of the hard work

180
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,350
their eyes getting all that information

181
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,140
from the screen they also need to take

182
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,080
frequent breaks from looking at screens

183
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,900
to prevent eye strain to prevent

184
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,009
injuring their eyes by using the

185
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,559
for too long things like that that orals

186
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,930
outs and glasses and maybe even other

187
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,080
more serious eye problems so frequent

188
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,270
breaks are the key to that what is

189
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,580
frequent this adjective means something

190
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,589
that happens quite often that happens

191
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:26,259
quite regularly it's not once every

192
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:28,779
month it's not once every year it's

193
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:31,389
maybe once a day twice a day or three

194
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:33,309
times a day or something like that if

195
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,870
you drink a lot of water you'll take

196
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,299
frequent trips to the bathroom because

197
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:39,820
you have to he've had a lot to drink all

198
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,289
right so it's something that happens a

199
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,448
lot if you're waiting for a bus well if

200
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:45,130
it's early in the morning you hope

201
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,110
there's a frequent bus you hope that bus

202
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,029
comes along every five minutes and not

203
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,790
every 25 minutes that would not be

204
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,579
frequent for example periods of extreme

205
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:58,510
heat have become more frequent in recent

206
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,250
years they happen more and more

207
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,430
in recent years and with less time

208
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,920
between them a lot more of them more

209
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,089
often than before

210
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:09,220
yeah interesting anyways additionally

211
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,040
while gamers are known for all-night

212
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,870
sessions they play all night long

213
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,810
sometimes it's important for them to get

214
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,449
enough sleep you have to sleep yeah

215
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:22,089
maintaining a healthy schedule makes a

216
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:24,399
gamer more disciplined which translates

217
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,649
into better performance in the game as

218
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,470
well so oh I need to practice all put in

219
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,839
an all-night session well that might

220
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,329
work for a while but after a while not

221
00:09:34,329 --> 00:09:36,940
having sleep that's bad for you so go

222
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,339
ahead be more disciplined get that sleep

223
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,380
and you will perform better in the game

224
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,230
as a result alright folks with that it's

225
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:46,360

enjoy the life of a pro gamer most pro

269
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:56,120
gamers are young and they often retire

270
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,800
from the sport around the same time

271
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,140
other people their age are graduating

272
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,840
from college so what can a professional

273
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,910
gamer expect to do for a living once

274
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:08,150
it's game over for them many become

275
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,580
professional streamers using their fame

276
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,500
to make money from advertising

277
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,930
others become coaches for younger

278
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,970
players or get involved with game

279
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,480
development

280
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:26,110
 pro-gamers most pro gamers are

281
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,290
young and they often retire from the

282
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,500
sport around the same time other people

283
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,980
their age are graduating from college so

284
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,260
there you go usually people who

285
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,010
graduated around 22 years of age this is

286
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,460
when most pro gamers retire how about

287
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,920
that by the way if you retire you leave

288
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,970
a career or a job or the workforce when

289
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,950
you're old or when you've made enough

290
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,870
money that you don't need to work

291
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,560
anymore and for pro gamers 22 apparently

292
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,220
is an old age so they retire now for

293
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,020
tennis players people think oh once you

294
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,740
reach the age of 35 that's all but for

295
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,510
the rest of us usually people retire

296
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:13,750
when they reach the age of 65 or 70 that

297
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:16,000
would be old enough that you can leave

298
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,360
the workplace for example Alice wants to

299
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,850
move to the countryside after she

300
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,190
retires yeah I'm done working I want to

301
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:26,140
move the countryside and take it easy

302
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,660
alright so there you go a very short

303
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,780
career 20 to 23 or certainly your early

304
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,720
20s your hands start to slow down your

305
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,180
eyes and your reaction time starts to

306
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,970
slow down like happens to almost every

307
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,640
athlete at some point in their career so

308
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,880
what can a professional gamer expect to

309
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,900
do for a living

310
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,590
once it's game over for them by here by

311
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,810
game over we mean it's time for them to

312
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,690
retire the life of a professional gamer

313
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,570
is no longer available so what do you do

314
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,910
you're you're quite young you're a video

315
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,670
game expert but you can't compete with

316
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:06,700
the really young kids well many become

317
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,760
professional streamers using their fame

318
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,190
to make money from advertising this is

319
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,080
that twitch thing we talked about which

320
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,180
a lot of you might know you can go on

321
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,430
there play games have people watch you

322
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,560
chat with you if you're really good

323
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,210
they'll learn from you and learn your

324
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:24,760
secrets and tips and also you can make

325
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,950
money from advertising in this way

326
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,320
basically make yourself a famous gamer

327
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,939
who people want to see play games and

328
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:33,889
stuff like that there's money to be made

329
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:36,739
there what is advertising advertising is

330
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,599
basically companies telling you about

331
00:14:38,599 --> 00:14:40,609
their products because they hope that

332
00:14:40,609 --> 00:14:42,799
the products will attract you and you

333
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,959
will buy them it can be a poster on a

334
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,899
side of a bus a sign by the road and ad

335
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:50,059
on the television or radio something

336
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:52,759
that pops up after your last YouTube

337
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:55,069
video to tell you about some new thing

338
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:57,079
basically that's what it is because

339
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:59,209
companies want your attention because

340
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:01,669
they want your money for example the

341
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:03,919
company has increased its spending on

342
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,649
advertising over the past few months

343
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:09,709
that's why you see a lot of their ads we

344
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:12,589
would say around town or on the Internet

345
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:15,139
right so some players do that and others

346
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:18,169
become coaches for younger players hey

347
00:15:18,169 --> 00:15:21,379
or get involved with game development so

348
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,449
they can help players become pro gamers

349
00:15:23,449 --> 00:15:25,399
and they can help game makers make

350
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,769
better games as well alright folks with

351
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,419
that it's time for us to you take a

352
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:30,739

game playing might sound like a dream

389
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,920
job at first but due to the punishing

390
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,140
practice schedule and the short shelf

391
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,660
life of a career in gaming it isn't all

392
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,599
fun and games in fact becoming a pro

393
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,970
gamer takes hard work and perseverance

394
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,550
two qualities that will help you find

395
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,250
success no matter what career path you

396
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:37,800
choose ok let's start to wrap things up

397
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:41,140
professional video game plane pro gaming

398
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:46,000
might sound like a dream job at first at

399
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,300
the beginning but once you delve into

400
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,040
the subject a little bit more you

401
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,160
realize that hmm is this really a dream

402
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,040
job or is it a little bit tougher than

403
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,740
that yeah absolutely playing games for

404
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,660
money you might sound like with eating

405
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,150
french fries for money that's great I

406
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,640
love french fries I'll do that yeah

407
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,040
think about it this is gonna be your

408
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,770
whole life so it says but so it might

409
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:14,560
sound like a dream job but due to the

410
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,170
punishing practice schedule and the

411
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,020
short shelf life of a career in gaming

412
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,690
it isn't all fun and games you'll have

413
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,090
to work really hard and your whole

414
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,580
career could be over before you're even

415
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:30,850
married by the early 20s so think about

416
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,460
it pretty carefully because it is a lot

417
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,990
harder than you would imagine

418
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,660
yep in fact becoming a pro gamer takes

419
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,140
hard work and perseverance two qualities

420
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,780
that will help you find success no

421
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:46,180
matter what career path you choose a

422
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,700
good point that being said you also have

423
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,980
to be young for the most part you don't

424
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,410
have to be young for other jobs and pro

425
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,470
gaming youth is extremely important

426
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,990
interesting alright folks that's

427
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,910
it for our article but we're not quite

428
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,090
done we still have the one question to

429
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:07,480
ask and then answer Mike after reading

430
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,790
this article do you think that being a

431
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,190
pro gamer sounds like a good career

432
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:14,830
choice for you why or why not

433
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,660
well I've watched a few shows about the

434
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,150
life of a pro gamer in the pro gaming

435
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,429
world and after watching those and

436
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:24,100
reading this I don't think I would want

437
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,530
to be a pro gamer because and this is

438
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:30,370
very simple I can't think of a game that

439
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:33,340
I would want to play for 60 hours a week

440
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,040
there's lots of games I love and I might

441
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,950
play it for 60 hours for one week but

442
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,720
then I get bored of it you know what I

443
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,460
mean I just wanna land cover your entire

444
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,160
life no not all the time every day all

445
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,320
day long I just can't think of a game

446
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,870
that I would want to play and no pong or

447
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:52,210
Tetris yeah no probably definitely not

448
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:54,760
those ones and I don't think if you you

449
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,530
you couldn't really just switch games

450
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,990
and be good at anyone so you'd have to

451
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,970
focus I just can't think of that great

452
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,220
game that I'd love to play forever me

453
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,730
neither

454
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,559

455
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,809

456
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:09,929
