00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
hi everyone this is karen hey everybody

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,479
i'm shane today we're looking at part

6
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:32,960
one

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,719
of the duck build platypus

8
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,840
the impossible animal and the vocabulary

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,719
words are

10
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,079
species species it is said that there

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,200
are over 9

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,960
000 bird species in the world poisonous

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,239
poisonous dan ate poisonous mushrooms by

14
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:52,960
accident

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,879
and had to go to the hospital amazed

16
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,840
amazed i was amazed that so many people

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,160
attended the concert

18
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,438
gene gene according to scientists

19
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,560
at least eight genes influence the final

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,119
color

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,320
of eyes

22
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,439
mirror you call that a mountain it is a

23
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,000
mere

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,759
hill okay so we're talking about this

25
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,479
impossible animal so you called it yes

26
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:22,960
the

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,400
duck build well what

28
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,680
makes it so impossible looking

29
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,560
is that it kind of looks like a duck

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,840
because of its bill

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,280
and its feet that's right but it also

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,600
has like the tail of a beaver

33
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,640
okay and it has the body of like an

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,119
otter so it's kind of like something

35
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,720
that you know you would see

36
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,119
in the in a kid's drawing yeah like a

37
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,560
kid will just draw something really

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,040
weird

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,960
and say it's an animal and you're like

40
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,399
that's not an animal

41
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,320
and it's an egg-laying mammal

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,360
which is so unique yes that's right well

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,479
that's because i think

44
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,000
it shares genes not only with mammals

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,199
but also with reptiles and birds that's

46
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,080
right

47
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,959
so they lay eggs right because usually

48
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,680
we know that mammals they don't lay eggs

49
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,160
it's like the definition of a mammal

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,480
exactly so that's what was so surprising

51
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,760
when they discovered this

52
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,239
animal and i think a long time ago they

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:24,959
used to be

54
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,280
much bigger right and they have become

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,000
you know like

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,480
smaller over the years right evolution

57
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,120
right

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,160
yeah they're adapting to the environment

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,000
that's pretty cool let's learn more

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,760
about this impossible animal

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,760
the duck build a platypus

62
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,360
the duck-billed platypus the impossible

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,319
animal

64
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,480
the duck-billed platypus is unique in

65
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,920
the animal kingdom

66
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,160
native to tasmania and southeastern

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,200
australia

68
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,680
this egg-laying mammal has the bill and

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,959
feet of a duck

70
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,680
the wide tail of a beaver and the body

71
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,040
of an otter

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,120
the male of the species even has

73
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,319
poisonous stingers

74
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,190
on the heels of its back feet

[Music]

76
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,920
today's lesson is called the duck build

77
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,840
platypus the

78
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,640
impossible animal part one

79
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,840
hi everyone my name is jeff and i'm

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
mike how does it exist if it's

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,159
impossible well it's just that

82
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,000
weird and actually when you do look at

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,319
lists or you know programs or

84
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,239
anything you might see about really

85
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,000
strange bizarre

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,560
animals that are almost too weird to

87
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,680
believe

88
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,400
the duckbilled platypus is right up

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,760
there at the top

90
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,720
of the list but impossible well it's

91
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,080
just really strange

92
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
really close to impossible close to him

93
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,840
somehow

94
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
someone told you about it and you didn't

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,640
know it was real you'd say that's not

96
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,159
real but it is but it is yeah i've heard

97
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,360
that the duck bill

98
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,799
platypus is a mammal

99
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,560
but it lays eggs which is weird that's

100
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,040
something that usually never happens but

101
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,760
let's not

102
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,798
get ahead of ourselves let's start

103
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,798
reading today's lesson

104
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,400
the duck build platypus is unique

105
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,600
in the animal kingdom it's unique

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,280
it's one of a kind so

107
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,479
should it exist based on the fact

108
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,600
that it's this unique probably not

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,560
but here we have it the duck build

110
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,919
platypus

111
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,080
and when you find out where it's from

112
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,800
that kind of explains why it might be so

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,080
unusual

114
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,960
native to tasmania and southeastern

115
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,360
australia

116
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,479
this egg-laying mammal has the bill

117
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,600
and feet of a duck the wide

118
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,639
tail of a beaver and the body

119
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,759
of an otter and get this hey

120
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,120
the male of the species

121
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,520
ease even has poisonous stingers

122
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,720
on the heels of its back feet it's also

123
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,240
very poisonous

124
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,520
wow so you got the duck

125
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,120
bill and you got the laying

126
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,000
oh my gosh what a weird creature but

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,120
also

128
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,440
a very cute creature i should say

129
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,039
anyways let's go ahead and talk about

130
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:35,600
the word

131
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
species scientists group animals

132
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,639
into different categories usually you go

133
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:43,280
from

134
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,560
big to small okay you start out with a

135
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,440
kingdom like

136
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,400
animals and you move all the way down

137
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,759
until you can't

138
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,680
separate animals any further okay when

139
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
you've gone the furthest you can

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,840
you've gotten to a species

141
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,440
okay a species of animal is a group of

142
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,800
animal okay the members of which can

143
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,039
mate with one another and produce viable

144
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,199
youth okay they can make babies and

145
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,680
those babies can make babies

146
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,360
as well like dogs and cats they're not

147
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
in the same species okay that's just not

148
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,639
the way that it works for example

149
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,840
it is said that there are over 9 000

150
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,840
bird species

151
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,880
in the world that's a lot of species

152
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,360
that is a lot of species absolutely and

153
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,639
we also have this word

154
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,360
poisonous it's an adjective that just

155
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,840
says

156
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,120
it has poison there is poison

157
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,759
in that thing something that if you get

158
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,360
it into your body

159
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,800
it can make you sick or possibly even

160
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
kill you and of course in the animal

161
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,199
world we talk about poisonous animals

162
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,319
spiders or certain types of little frogs

163
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,599
or snakes

164
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,000
things like this lions are very

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,960
dangerous

166
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,120
sharks are very dangerous but not

167
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
because they're poisonous

168
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,280
because they have big sharp teeth but

169
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,520
some smaller animals and some types of

170
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,160
plants

171
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,960
mushrooms for example if you eat them if

172
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,360
they

173
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
bite you if they put their poison inside

174
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,120
you

175
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,280
it can make you very sick they are

176
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
poisonous for example

177
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,800
dan ate poisonous mushrooms by accident

178
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,440
and had to go to the hospital yeah many

179
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,360
mushrooms can be poisonous

180
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,400
don't go wild mushroom picking unless

181
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,199
you're very

182
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,440
sure about what you're doing all right

183
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,800
let's take a break and then we'll be

184
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,520
back with

185
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800

animal

190
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,640
the platypus truly is like something out

191
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,800
of a child's imagination

192
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,880
it's no wonder that in the late 18th

193
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,399
century when the first

194
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,320
samples were brought back to europe from

195
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,160
the australian continent

196
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,480
scientists of the time didn't believe

197
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,839
they were real

198
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,120
okay earlier i said that the duck

199
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,920
build platypus kind of sounds like

200
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,200
something that

201
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,320
comes out of science fiction well

202
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,519
more precisely the platypus here

203
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,279
truly is like something out of a child's

204
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:30,640
imagination i would say that's more

205
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,120
or a fairy tale or something like that

206
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,399
the platypus is

207
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,440
truly is like is truly

208
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
is like something out of a child's

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
imagination and

210
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,920
actually a lot of people didn't believe

211
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,160
it when they first heard about it it's

212
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,279
no wonder or it's no surprise that in

213
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:49,920
the late

214
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,120
18th century when the first samples were

215
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,800
brought back to europe

216
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,240
from the australian continent scientists

217
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,360
of the time

218
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,320
didn't believe they were real they

219
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,079
thought someone had just taken some

220
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,920
different animals and

221
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,240
put it together and said look we found

222
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,560
this body of this strange animal

223
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,640
and a lot of scientists in europe who

224
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,000
didn't see it

225
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,720
living said that's not real you just

226
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,120
made that up in your lab or something

227
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,959
like that this is what happened

228
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,800
in the late 18th century the first

229
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,519
explorers going down there to australia

230
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,360
caught some animals brought them home

231
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
some of them i guess didn't live

232
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,519
they only brought the bodies back and so

233
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,480
these scientists in paris and london and

234
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
places like that would look at these

235
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
things and go that can't be

236
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,040
real you just put together a bunch of

237
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
different animals and you're trying to

238
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,000
sell us a whole story it's not

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,519
true that doesn't jive without european

240
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,519
science like a mermaid weird australian

241
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,200
animals no way we're not accepting this

242
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,200
anyways folks with that it's time for us

243
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,800
to take a short break but don't go away

244
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,839
we have more for you on the duck bill

245
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,839
platypus after this yeah

246
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,519
are cute fluffy and cuddly

247
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,079
it's no wonder that people love keeping

248
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:06,560
them

249
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,279
as pets

250
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,200
the duck build platypus the impossible

251
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,240
animal

252
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,639
more recently researchers were amazed to

253
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,440
discover

254
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,680
that platypuses share genes with not

255
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
only mammals

256
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,399
but also reptiles and birds it turns out

257
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,560
that these odd creatures split off from

258
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,480
the rest of the mammal class

259
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
some 166 million years ago

260
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,399
during the age of the dinosaurs ancient

261
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,880
platypuses were about a meter long

262
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,000
but over time they got smaller today the

263
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,320
average platypus measures a mere 50

264
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,920
centimeters from its head

265
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,399
to the tip of its tail and weighs in at

266
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,480
around 1.5 kilograms

267
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,000
anyways let's let's forget about the

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,079
past and talk about

269
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,839
right now real science yeah more science

270
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,040
real science right now more recently

271
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,920
researchers were amazed to discover

272
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,320
that platypuses shared genes

273
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,360
with not only mammals but

274
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,720
also reptiles and birds so

275
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,920
if you're gonna classify this particular

276
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,519
animal based on its genetics

277
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,480
is it a reptile is it a mammal

278
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,519
is it a bird it's all of those is it all

279
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,199
of those

280
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,079
weird by the way if you are amazed by

281
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,360
something

282
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,880
you are usually really surprised by that

283
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,920
thing

284
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,040
in a good way you're amazed you're

285
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,440
shocked in a good way

286
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,120
for example i was amazed that so many

287
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:03,680
people

288
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,639
attended the concert okay well yeah and

289
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,079
if you didn't want them you might have

290
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:08,399
been

291
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,519
horrified or shocked or something like

292
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,519
that but you said this is a good thing

293
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,440
so you were amazed and sure when you're

294
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
a scientist and you make some incredible

295
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,160
discovery that's not you know a terrible

296
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:20,560
thing

297
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,720
you put on your genes you will be amazed

298
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,600
and especially

299
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,160
it might be involved with jeans but

300
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,639
we're not talking about blue jeans those

301
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,360
pants

302
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,399
cowboy wear no not cowboy cool

303
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,600
that's not j-e-a-n

304
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,040
those are j-e-a-n genes these are

305
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,759
n e genes we're talking about the

306
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,880
building blocks

307
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,720
of life protein dna the things that

308
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,880
create life yeah when we're talking

309
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,160
about dna

310
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
we're talking about genes and we're

311
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,079
talking about parents having children

312
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,880
and passing on traits like blonde hair

313
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,639
or dark eyes or

314
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,199
things like that we're talking about

315
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,240
genes and yes

316
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,240
animals of course you know will give

317
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,920
their genes to their children and

318
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,639
different species of animals sometimes

319
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,040
share

320
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,120
genes right we look different from

321
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,079
gorillas

322
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,360
or chimpanzees those those apes but we

323
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:15,759
share

324
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,279
many of the same genes making us similar

325
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,199
but not quite the same so apparently a

326
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,079
platypus is similar to birds

327
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,800
and mammals and things like that we

328
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,120
humans we're mammals but we don't have

329
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,000
many of the same genes that birds would

330
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,320
because we're quite different if we

331
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
share genes with uh

332
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,079
ducks we might have a duck bill feathers

333
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,880
but uh we don't we don't quack unlike

334
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,680
females

335
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,839
duck filled platypus exactly and

336
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,279
according to scientists

337
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,040
at least eight genes influence the final

338
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:51,839
color of

339
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
eyes of all the genes that go up to

340
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,360
making a people

341
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,839
making a person eight different genes

342
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,079
can affect the color of your eyes that's

343
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,279
a very interesting fact

344
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,519
anyways let's dive deeper into this

345
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,880
whole gene

346
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,160
thing it turns out that these odd

347
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,559
creatures split off from the rest of the

348
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,199
mammal

349
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,000
class like us some 166

350
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,599
million years ago during the age

351
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,959
of the dinosaurs wow yeah

352
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,319
just that long ago humans have been our

353
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,000
own special group for like half a

354
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,240
million years or something like that yep

355
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,880
now

356
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,000
ancient platypuses were about

357
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,360
a meter long but over time

358
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,559
they got smaller oh yeah animals over

359
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:42,880
the

360
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
over the course of the last oh 100

361
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,600
million uh 150 million years have

362
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,520
generally gotten smaller

363
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,440
that's true oh pretty much across the

364
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,120
board so that makes sense so there you

365
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,400
go a meter long

366
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,480
duck build platypus would be a little

367
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,640
bit of a scarier type of

368
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,720
that would be a big duck-billed platter

369
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,080
if it was angry with you

370
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,760
all right well let's move on and see

371
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,679
what it says next today the average

372
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,559
platypus

373
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,600
measures a mere 50 centimeters

374
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,799
from its head to the tip of its tail and

375
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,600
weighs in at around

376
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,440
1.5 kilograms these are not

377
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,000
large animals 50 centimeters that's

378
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,559
like half a meter that's half a meter

379
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,440
yeah

380
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,880
pretty small anyways here we have the

381
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,720
word mir the word

382
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,480
mir means only or just it's

383
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,200
that's all you have to know it's these

384
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,000
animals are

385
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,039
just 50 centimeters okay

386
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,280
you can measure them from there from the

387
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,039
head to the tip of the tail

388
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,240
and they'll only or just be 50

389
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,960
centimeters long that's all there is to

390
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,600
it

391
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,600
for example you call that a mountain

392
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,880
it's a mere hill

393
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
that's something they might say in

394
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,480
australia all right folks

395
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,679

396
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,240
well i'll see you next time chaps

397
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,320
he split off from the other hikers and

398
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,840
ended up getting lost

399
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:42,840
[Music]

400
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,000
foreign

401
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,799
there is an area at the zoo to keep the

402
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,640
birds that can't fly

403
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,600
emus are large birds similar to

404
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,960
ostriches

405
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,200
in fact they are the second tallest

406
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
birds in the world

407
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,840
after ostriches they can grow to be just

408
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,960
under 2 meters tall only 6 months

409
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,679
after being hatched from their eggs

410
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,280
emirs can't fly

411
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,799
but they can run really fast for a short

412
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:11,280
time

413
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,240
they can reach up to 50 kilometers per

414
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,600
hour

415
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,640
male emus take care of the eggs and take

416
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,360
a break from eating for weeks

417
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,159
male and female emus look very similar

418
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,159
these birds are representative of

419
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,520
australia

420
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,559
the government puts emus on coins

421
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,000
and the coat of arms for the country

422
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,120
their legs don't have any feathers their

423
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,640
eyesight and hearing

424
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,799
are really good at keeping them safe

425
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,480
from predators

426
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,880
at the zoo they have nothing to worry

427
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,679
about

428
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,720
emus usually live between 10 to

429
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,000
30 years we have one named larry that is

430
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,080
15 years old

431
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,440
here is more information

432
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,480
adapt cindy tried hard to

433
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,840
adapt herself to the new school

434
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,120
camouflage an octopus can

435
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,159
camouflage itself to hide from other

436
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,159
animals

437
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,679
balance lisa lost her balance

438
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,080
and fell from the chair eyesight

439
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,200
sam has excellent eyesight so

440
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,600
he doesn't need glasses flightless

441
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,880
penguins are flightless birds

442
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,080
hearing rick's hearing is bad

443
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,840
so you have to yell when you talk to him

444
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,440
incubate birds incubate their eggs

445
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,440

447
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,919
