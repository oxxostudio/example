1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,589
it is not death most people are afraid

2
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,980
of it is getting to the end of life only

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,029
to realize that you never truly lived

4
00:00:20,029 --> 00:00:22,980
there was a study done a hospital study

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,820
on 100 elderly people facing death close

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,939
to their last breath they were asked to

7
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,159
reflect about their life's biggest

8
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,690
regret nearly all of them said they

9
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,829
regretted not the things they did but

10
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,610
the things they didn't do the risks they

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,300
never took the dreams they didn't pursue

12
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,620
I ask you would your last words be if

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,780
only I had hey you wake up why do you

14
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,660
exist life is not meant to simply work

15
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,570
wait for the weekend and pay rent no no

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,700
I don't know much but I know this every

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,640
person on this earth has a gift and I

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,280
apologize to the black community but I

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,250
can no longer pretend Martin Luther King

20
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,450
that man never had a dream that dream

21
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,439
had him see people don't choose dreams

22
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:25,110
dreams choose them so the question I'm

23
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,960
getting to is do you have the courage to

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,720
grab the dream that picked you that be

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,570
fits you and grips you a would you let

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,130
it get away and slip through

27
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:39,020
you know I learned the fact about

28
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,909
airplanes the other day now this was

29
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:42,979
this was so surprised and see I was

30
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,170
talking to a pilot and he told me that

31
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,150
many of his passengers they planes are

32
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,600
dangerous to fly in but he said actually

33
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,960
it is a lot more dangerous for a plane

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,650
to stay on the ground I said what like

35
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,450
how does that sound well he said he said

36
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,670
because on the ground the plane starts

37
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,280
to rust malfunction and we're much

38
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,890
faster than it ever would if it was in

39
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,449
the air as I walked away I thought yeah

40
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,410
makes total sense

41
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,570
because planes were built to live in the

42
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:17,270
skies and every person was built to live

43
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:20,450
out the dream they have inside so it is

44
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,150
perhaps the saddest loss to live a life

45
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,980
on the ground without ever taking off

46
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,390
see most of us are afraid of the thief

47
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,310
that comes in the night to steal all of

48
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,410
our things but there's a thief in your

49
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,750
mind who is after your dreams

50
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,450
his name is doubt if you see him call

51
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,400
the cops and keep him away from the kids

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,769
cuz he is wanted for murder for he is

53
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:44,780
killed more dreams than failure ever did

54
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,900
he wears many disguises and like a virus

55
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,730
will leave you blind and divided and

56
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:53,239
turned you into a kinda see kinda is

57
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:53,840
lethal

58
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,269
you know what kinda is it's a lot of

59
00:02:56,269 --> 00:02:59,450
kind of people you kind of want a career

60
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,250
change you kind of want to get straight

61
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,670
A's you kind of want to get in shape

62
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,980
simple math no numbers to crunch if you

63
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,110
kind of want something that you will

64
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,049
kind of get the results you want what is

65
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:14,390
your dream what ignites that spark you

66
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,769
can't kind of want that

67
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:17,840
you gotta wonder with every part of your

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,510
whole heart would you struggle yeah yeah

69
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,579
you will struggle no way around it you

70
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:24,620
will fall many times but who's counting

71
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,769
just remember there's no such thing as a

72
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,530
smooth Mountain if you want to make it

73
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,450
to the top then there are sharp ridges

74
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,400
that must be stepped over there will be

75
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,230
times you get stressed and things you

76
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,969
get depressed over but let me tell you

77
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,549
something Steven Spielberg was rejected

78
00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:42,739
from film school three times three times

79
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:45,590
but he kept going the television execs

80
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:48,019
fired Oprah said she wasn't fit for TV

81
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,810
but she kept going critics told beyond

82
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,609
saving she couldn't sing she went

83
00:03:52,609 --> 00:03:55,840
through depression but she kept going

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,950
struggle and criticisms are

85
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,200
prerequisites for greatness that is the

86
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,150
law of this universe and no one escapes

87
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,790
it because pain is life but you can

88
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:06,739
choose what type either the pain on the

89
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:09,439
road to success or the pain of being

90
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,310
haunted with regret

91
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,580
you are my advice don't think twice we

92
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,620
have been given a gift then we call life

93
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,680
so don't blow it you are not defined by

94
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,410
your past instead you are born anew in

95
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,640
each moment so own it now

96
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,200
sometimes you gotta leap and grow your

97
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,350
wings on the way down you better get the

98
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:34,060
shot off before the clock runs out

99
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,070
because they know over time in life no

100
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,260
do-over and I know I sound like I'm

101
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,720
preaching on speaking with force but if

102
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,520
you don't use your gift then you sail

103
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,130
not only yourself but the whole world

104
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,730
sure so what invention that you have

105
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,370
buried in your mind what idea what cure

106
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,400
what skill do you have inside to bring

107
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,340
out to this universe you need meaning

108
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,040
one verse meaning song you have a part

109
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,020
to play in this song so grab that

110
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,450
microphone and be brave sing your heart

111
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,510
out on life stage you cannot go back in

112
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,850
and make a brand new beginning but you

113
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,660
can start now

114
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,570
and make a brand new ending
