i'm batman and the vocabulary words are

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,320
psychological psychological treatments

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,079
for psychological conditions

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,800
have improved in recent years

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,760
frustration

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,399
frustration the constant construction

14
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,120
delays

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,600
have been a big source of frustration

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,039
for us

17
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,480
anxiety anxiety pete has been feeling

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,120
a lot of anxiety over his decision to

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,199
break up with his girlfriend

20
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,840
investigate investigate the company

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,119
created a team

22
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,080
to investigate what caused the accident

23
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,799
at its factory researcher

24
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,600
researcher through their experiments

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,080
researchers have learned a lot

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,040
about the disease so we're talking about

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,000
i can do it

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,600
i'm batman what does that mean

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,799
so this is a very interesting like

30
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,360
psychological

31
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
effect okay that's called the batman

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,400
effect

33
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,960
the batman effect so it basically it's

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
like you imagine

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,280
that you are a fictional character

36
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,119
usually somebody who has like

37
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,479
super powers or who's very very

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,200
strong or amazing and then you kind of

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,119
pretend you're that person when you're

40
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,640
doing things that you

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,880
need to do especially some challenges

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,759
that you're facing

43
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,000
and usually when you think with that

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,600
kind of mentality

45
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,840
you would usually perform better right

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
so they did an experiment right with

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,320
some kids

48
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,719
that's right and they divided the kids

49
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,799
up in three different groups and then

50
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,080
they were given tasks

51
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,919
to complete right so the first group i

52
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,840
think uh they were told to ask

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,440
the children to ask themselves the

54
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,480
question uh am i working hard

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,319
for the first group and the second group

56
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,160
was you know thinking from

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,480
a third person narrative it's like is

58
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
sam working hard

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,319
is shane working hard that's right but

60
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,280
the third group

61
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
you're trying to pretend that you are a

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,760
fictional character for example batman

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,800
is batman working hard obviously not

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,720
hard enough because batman will work

65
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,519
really hard

66
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,519
and that has superpowers yeah and so

67
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:40,560
those those

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,040
kids actually performed better that's

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,680
right

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,519
so that's really interesting that's our

71
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,120
interesting psychological effect

72
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,200

139
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,240
effect and when we use this adjective

140
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,360
psychological

141
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,520
we're talking about the mind about

142
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,360
thinking about behavior

143
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,759
about your emotions about that kind of

144
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,479

your muscles get bigger

148
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,800
or turn you into a superhero but it

149
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,319
might change your mental

150
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,960
attitude your mental state the kind of

151
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,039
way it would be like i'm good enough i'm

smart enough i can do this you know say

153
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240

154
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,960
psychological effect an effect on your

155
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,840
mind

156
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,880
for example treatments for psychological

157
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,800
conditions have improved in recent years

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,319
okay next let's talk about frustration

159
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,440
frustration i

160
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,560

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,919

okay if you want okay if you want a good

163
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,080
picture of frustration

164
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,440
picture that rubik's cube that

165
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,280
has not been finished since 1987. for

166
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
that video game boss you just can't

167
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,360
beat that game you haven't beat since

168
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,520
1984

169
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,360
the rubik's cube you haven't been able

170
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,599
to solve since 1987.

171
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,080
these things that you want to do but you

172
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,800
can't

173
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,000
and they leave you frustrated you're not

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,840
hitting your head against

175
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,680
your head against the wall to frustrate

176
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,960
would be the verb

177
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,280
frustration is the feeling that's the

178
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,120
noun for example

179
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,319
the constant construction delays have

180
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,120
been

181
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,880
a big source of frustration for us oh

182
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
we can't finish our work because they

183
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,280
won't stop

184
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,000
absolutely and frustration can lead to

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,880
problems

186
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,199
with your psychology right problems with

187
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,479
your feelings and your

188
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,199
thinking and that could lead to anxiety

189
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
now that's a psychological condition

190
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
because anxiety is stress

191
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,080
it's worry it's that feeling that things

192
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
are bad and they're only going to get

193
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
worse and nothing's going to go well and

194
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,520
i'm so nervous and stressed out and i

195
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,080
can't relax i can't sleep i can't eat

196
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,400
i'm filled with anxiety i need to do

197
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,520
some yoga

198
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,759
i need to calm down maybe take a little

199
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,960
holiday

200
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,120
you know relax a little bit because

201
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240
anxiety

202
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,360
is that feeling of stress and worry like

203
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
you have problems and you can't shut

204
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,800
them off in your mind

205
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,280
you're always thinking always worrying

206
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,039
and it's affecting your life

207
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,599
for example pete has been feeling a lot

208
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,960
of anxiety

209
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,599
over his decision to break up with his

210
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,319
girlfriend

211
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,240
all right well let's take a break we can

212
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,000
do it we're batman

213
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,919
and we'll be back and nothing's going to

214
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,120
stop us

215
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:27,840
except the joker maybe i'm batman hello

216
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
um

217
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,440
i can do it i'm batman the effect which

218
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,480
has become known as

219
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,880
the batman effect was first formally

220
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
investigated in a 2016

221
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,680
study at the university of minnesota

222
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,839
researchers gave a group of six-year-old

223
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,000
children a difficult task to complete on

224
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
a computer

225
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,880
[Music]

226
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,800
i could do it you can do it i'm back

227
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,000
because you are

228
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,480
i'm a batman you're batman kind of

229
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,040
batman i can't be wonder woman

230
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,320
i suppose yeah but anyway yeah believing

231
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,079
that you can do it and saying you are

232
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,959
batman or

233
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,360
wonder woman possibly well it's a real

234
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,560
thing but again

235
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,880
you can say i'm wondering a wonder woman

236
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,000
but wonder woman

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,279
has super powers she's like a goddess

238
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,200
whereas batman is just

239
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,480
a rich human regular human anyways

240
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,920
stuff with with cool stuff the effect

241
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,640
which has become known as the batman

242
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,040
effect

243
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,120
good name was first formally

244
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
investigated

245
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,000
in 2000 in a 2016 study

246
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,640
at the university of minnesota and yes

247
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,800
sometimes these studies they come up

248
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,079
with with some very

249
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,360
boring names hmm so people

250
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,000
feel more confident about themselves

251
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,880
when they say

252
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,279
i can do it i'm batman a positive

253
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,360
reinforcement effect let's call this the

254
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,680
positive reinforcement effect or oh i

255
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,200
don't know the

256
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,000
batman effect that's that's another word

257
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,440
associated with that

258
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,399
with this anyways anyways if we are

259
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,839
talking about

260
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,399
um research let's say if we're talking

261
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,240
about studies let's say

262
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,519
usually we're talking about things that

263
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,680
people have done smart people like

264
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,639
scientists

265
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,320
people these people have looked into

266
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,200
something to learn a lot about it

267
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,560
they have investigated these things yes

268
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,839
when you investigate

269
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,279
something you look into that thing you

270
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,639
study that thing deeply in order to

271
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,040
learn more about it you can be a

272
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,160
scientist

273
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,959
and investigate something to learn about

274
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,200
it

275
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,519
let's say you want to learn more about

276
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,519
physics or some subject or something

277
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,079
like that

278
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,519
for example a company created a team to

279
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,800
investigate

280
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,200
what caused the accident at its factory

281
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,480
detective i batman they're here way to

282
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:44,959
go

283
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,600
all right now researchers in order to

284
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,920
investigate the batman effect what did

285
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,000
they exactly do they didn't read a bunch

286
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,399
of comic books or watch a bunch of

287
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,240
batman movies no

288
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,279
researchers gave a group of six-year-old

289
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,160
children

290
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,120
a difficult task to complete on a

291
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,920
computer

292
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,680
alright so this kind of thing that would

293
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,000
be frustrating a difficult

294
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,800
task it's not easy to do it's easy to

295
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,920
mess up and

296
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,839
make mistakes so they gave a bunch of

297
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,920
kids six-year-old children

298
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,800
something difficult to do or to complete

299
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,279
on a computer and we can imagine that a

300
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,800
lot of them won't do it they'll get

301
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,680
frustrated

302
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,079
this was the study this is what the

303
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,560
researchers were doing researchers will

304
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
investigate things

305
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,560
not a detective but the same kind of

306
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,480
idea they're looking into something they

307
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,079
have a lot of questions

308
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,160
they're looking for answers they use

309
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,959
tests and science and information

310
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,639
and all of that kind of stuff when

311
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,639
scientists want to know anything about

312
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,440
anything

313
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,160
what people do how animals behave what

314
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,760
kind of medicine will

315
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,279
fight covid researchers will do studies

316
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,600
smart people will do tests in other

317
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,959
words for example

318
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,440
through their experiments researchers

319
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,959
have learned a lot

320
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,360
about the disease scientists doing

321
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,399
experiments

322
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,199
researchers doing studies they want to

323
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:07,680
answer

324
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,760
questions there you go all right folks

325
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,680
with that it's time for us to

326
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,399
take a break we'll see you after the

327
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,279
break

328
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,480
detective i'm batman he's batman

329
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
is

330
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,240
i can do it i'm batman the children were

331
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,480
then divided into three groups

332
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,560
in the first the children were told to

333
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
regularly ask themselves

334
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,279
am i working hard in the second they

335
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,040
were told to ask themselves the same

336
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,600
question

337
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,480
in the third person as in is sam working

338
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,440
hard

339
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,199
and in the third group they were told to

340
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,720
pretend they were a hard-working

341
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,920
fictional character

342
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,759
and to ask themselves if the character

343
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,199
was working hard

344
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,839
for example they could ask themselves is

345
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,759
batman working hard

346
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,680
remarkably the children in the third

347
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,839
group performed by far the best

348
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,839
and took fewer breaks than the children

349
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,959
in the other two groups

350
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,759
okay let's get back into things we were

351
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,040
talking about a

352
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,279
study some research before the break

353
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,279
there now the children

354
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,480
in this research were then divided

355
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,279
into three groups so they're all doing

356
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,320
the same task

357
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,320
but three groups now three groups okay

358
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,759
okay but they're all doing the same

359
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,800
thing yes right now right

360
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,560
in the first the children were told to

361
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,079
regularly ask themselves am i

362
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,639
working hard this is difficult am i

363
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,639
working hard i'm working hard i'm having

364
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,399
trouble but am i working hard

365
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,360
okay am i working hard in the second

366
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,680
they were told to ask themselves the

367
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
same question

368
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,320
in the third person so not am

369
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,679
i is he as in is sam

370
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,240
working hard so if i was doing it is

371
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:08,720
mike

372
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,359
working hard is jeff working and you're

373
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,000
thinking not

374
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,359
am i working about am is is okay so like

375
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,480
another person is watching me do this

376
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,959
job i know where this is going this is

377
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,079
this is awesome

378
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,959
okay and in the third group they were

379
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,880
told to pretend

380
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,840
they were a hard-working fictional

381
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,559
character

working hard and what happened well

401
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,520
remarkably

402
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,640
amazingly the children in the third

403
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,720
group the batman group

404
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,760
performed by far by far

405
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,400
the best and took fewer breaks than the

406
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,200
children

407
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,120
in the other two groups this is a

408
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,400
difficult task

409
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,080
and the kids who thought of themselves

410
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,679
as batman doing it

411
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,240
they did better not just a little bit a

412
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,720
lot

413
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,240
better by far the best and they worked

414
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,280
harder they took

415
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,600
fewer breaks than the kids in the other

416
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,760
group does batman take breaks

417
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,600
no no does he fail no no of course not

418
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,240
so

419
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,960
that's pretty cool the batman effect

420
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,480
