11
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:43,200
food

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,760
roy was content to lie on the couch for

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,280
a few hours

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,160
community community after the recent

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,199
robberies

16
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,000
people in the community no longer feel

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,440
safe

18
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,320
confess confess randy confessed to

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,760
stealing john's eraser

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,600
my friend warned me not to go out at

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,159
such a late hour

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,960
hopeful hopeful the movie contains a

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,240
hopeful message

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,760
so we're still talking about this

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,080
interesting story about this guy named

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,960
martin

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,439
right so now he's tom so now he's down

28
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:20,479
right but he's

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,880
really martin that's right pretending to

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,520
be tom

31
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,439
and i think he's enjoying his life at

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,720
the farmhouse yeah

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,880
so i think he's going to at least stay

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,000
for a while

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,640
because he's going to enjoy it while he

36
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,439
can

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,960
he doesn't want to go back to his

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
troubled life before

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,119
i guess you're right and then he noticed

40
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,960
something weird though when he's walking

41
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,360
around in the neighborhood or community

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,200
he noticed that people are kind of just

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,799
staring at him and they

44
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,360
are not very friendly right so i wonder

45
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:49,920
what this

46
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,320
tom guy did it looks like tom did

47
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,640
something pretty bad or he was just a

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,960
bad guy in general we're not really sure

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,799
and then one day the old guy george

50
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,479
warned him about something yeah there's

51
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,040
somebody called michael lay

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,080
and he wants to kill tom

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
so he knows that michael's going to be

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,520
coming to try to kill him

55
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,480
that's right martin who he thinks is tom

56
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,360
right

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,680
and so george gives him some money and

58
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,920
it says okay why don't you go away for a

59
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,360
few days

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,480
so he does that's right okay that's you

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:28,800
know

62
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,120
a lot of money i can pretty much have a

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,480
fresh start

64
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,319
and see what happens so maybe he doesn't

65
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,000
need to go back maybe he can

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,560
start his own farm somewhere or it

67
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,280
sounds like

68
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
a really good story for martin yeah but

69
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,440
you never know but you'll have to keep

70
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,599
reading to find out maybe there will be

71
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,319
a twist

72
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,200
in the end enjoy the story enjoy

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,800
the hounds of fate as the days went by

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,959
martin became more and more content on

75
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,000
the farm

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,640
while riding tom's horse into town he

77
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,480
thought it wouldn't be so bad to stay

78
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,440
for a while

79
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,519
but there was a lot about tom that

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,560
martin didn't know

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,239
today's lesson is called the hounds of

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,360
fate

83
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,959
part two hello everyone i am jeff

84
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,599
and i am mike and we are not martin

85
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,480
stoner or

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,280
master tom no they are the same

87
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,920
character

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,879
we think in our story martin stoner was

89
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,519
this

90
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,159
lost young man who felt that life was

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,840
going really badly

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,480
until he found a farmhouse where this

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,040
family welcomed him in but called him

94
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,319
master tom now martin was so hungry and

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,319
tired he didn't care what they called

96
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:48,799
him

97
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,879
he was happy they were giving him food

98
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,360
and a place to rest but it turns out

99
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,760
the family at least the aunt in the

100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,480
family

101
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,799
was very angry with him and she said you

102
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,080
can come in my house

103
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,159
but i'm not going to talk to you or even

104
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,120
look at you

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,840
for what you did before martin has no

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,599
idea what's going on

107
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:10,400
he's just happy to be somewhere safe now

108
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,439
martin is martin

109
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,799
martin and the hounds of fate are on his

110
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,519
heels he felt they were and he's luck

111
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,759
into the situation you've got

112
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,839
uncle george there he's going to take

113
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,800
him in there

114
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,160
the aunt there she doesn't like master

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,120
tom but

116
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,479
george thinks yes that martin stoner is

117
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,280
master tom right but he's not that's

118
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:33,600

119
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,759
martin but martin's happy to pretend to

120
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,639
be tom

121
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,960
because his life is better now he's

122
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,840
happy to

123
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,560
assume the role and as the days went by

124
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,240
martin became more and more content

125
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,600

have me live with them and if you're

133
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,479

you're pretty happy with it you're

135
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,560

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,720
greatest thing that ever happened to you

137
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,520
and you're overjoyed all the time but

138
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
you don't have anything serious to

139
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
complain about everything is just

140
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,320
it's okay it's fine it's it's good

141
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,199
enough

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,000
for example with a belly full of food

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,800
roy was content to lie on the couch

144
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,520
for a few hours it wasn't the best meal

145
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,479
of his life

146
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,120
he wasn't sitting in a luxury spot a

147
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,560
five-star hotel

148
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,800
or anything but he was perfectly happy

149
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,400
he had a good sandwich

150
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,759

152
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,400
town

153
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,479
it's not his own it's tom's yeah but

154
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,160
he's tom remember

155
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
he thinks he is he's assuming he's

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,759
pretending to be while

157
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,720
riding tom's horse into town he thought

158
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,000
it wouldn't be so

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,720
bad to stay for a while it's pretty good

161
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,080

162
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,919
about tom that martin

163
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
didn't know remember the aunt she

164
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,560
doesn't want to talk to him

165
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,600
or see him so what

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,840
did tom do he's pretending to be someone

167
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,880
he doesn't know

168
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,039
and maybe that person he's pretending to

169
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,080
be

170
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,199

171
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,000
ahead and

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,479
take a break and when we come back we'll

173
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,199
continue

174
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,160
reading from the hounds of faith

175
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,720
ed overjoyed

176
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,720
the hounds of fate in town the locals

177
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,800
scowled and stared at martin

178
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,879
he wondered what tom could have done to

179
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,960
anger the entire community

180
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,039
but he didn't want to confess his true

181
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,280
identity and go back to a life of

182
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,680
rambling around the countryside

183
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,000
one day martin discovered an album with

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,199
photos of tom

185
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,520
and saw with his own eyes the uncanny

186
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,520
resemblance between them

187
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,479
later george warned martin that michael

188
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,000
lay was back in the village

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,039
and that he had sworn to kill tom he

190
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,520
gave martin some money from tom's aunt

191
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,840
and told him to get away for a few days

192
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,759
so there he was riding a horse

193
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,800
yeah not long ago things were looking

194
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,199
bad for

195
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,800
martin stoner now he's master tom he's

196
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,719
living on the farm he's content and he's

197
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,360
riding a horse into town but

198
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,440
in town the locals scowled

199
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,440
and stared at martin

200
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,880
this tom guy he did something bad

201
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,120
that's right everyone still thinks he's

202
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,360
tom now martin thought i'll just pretend

203
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,320
to be tom who cares well it turns out

204
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,880
people don't like tom so maybe he's

205
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,760
pretending

206
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,560
to be a pretty bad person so martin of

207
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,920
course starts to wonder

208
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,839
why are people scowling at me and giving

209
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,040
me dirty looks

210
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,160
and stuff like that he wondered what tom

211
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
could have done to anger the entire

212
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,800
community

213
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,839
but he didn't want to confess his true

214
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,120
identity

215
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
and go back to a life of rambling around

216
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,080
the countryside remember

217
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,320
before he found this family that took

218
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,360
him in he was

219
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,279
rambling around the countryside he was

220
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,760
on his own he was poor he had nowhere to

221
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,240
stay

222
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,040
no food life was pretty tough he doesn't

223
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
want to go back to that

224
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,600
but he doesn't want to tell the truth of

225
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,440
course then he'll get kicked out and

226
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,760
have to go back to his difficult life

227
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,880
but what did he do or what did this tom

228
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,760
guy do

229
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,720
to make everyone so angry with him and

230
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,240
if they all think he's

231
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,360
tom he can't ask them what did i

232
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,519
do what did i do that's right you know

233
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,200
what you did

234
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,399
tom yeah anyways here we've got the word

235
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,279
community

236
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,600
here we're talking about a community

237
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,640
we're talking about

238
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,680
a group of people who live together

239
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,760
like a small village is a community in

240
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,480
this particular situation a community

241
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,720
is a small group of people who live

242
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,519
together

243
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,560
who share common bonds that's pretty

244
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:18,959
much

245
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,240
the idea here for example after the

246
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,880
recent

247
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,240
robberies people in the community

248
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,279
no longer feel safe yes

249
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,160
everybody in the community they're all

250
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,839
paying attention they're

251
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,279
all being very very careful at night

252
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,600
because they don't want to be robbed

253
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
right in this case the community is this

254
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
village and the farms that all are

255
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
that are all around it all the people

256
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,200
there and of course

257
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,920
martin doesn't want to tell the truth

258
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,519
and say hey i'm not tom

259
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,600
i don't know why you're angry with me

260
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,920
i'm just pretending to be tom that's of

261
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,240
course a terrible thing to do

262
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,480
so he doesn't want to tell the truth and

263
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,560
say i'm just this other guy and i was

264
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,680
pretending

265
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,920
i'm just taking food from this family

266
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,160
because i'm kind of a not nice person

267
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,600
but i'm not tom

268
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,680
no because that would be to confess to

269
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,839
confess is to tell the truth

270
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,680
especially when you're telling the truth

271
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
about something bad about a

272
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,720
crime or some terrible action to come

273
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,959
clean if you're lying about it that's

274
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,399
one thing but then if you say i don't

275
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,399
want to lie anymore i want to tell the

276
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,120
truth

277
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,240
about something bad you are confessing

278
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,040
for example

279
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,240
randy confessed to stealing john's

280
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,120
eraser

281
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
anyways go ahead and move on yeah one

282
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,760
day martin discovered

283
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,040
an album with photos a photo album a

284
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,160
photo album okay

285
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,200
with photos of tom and

286
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,360
saw with his own eyes the uncanny

287
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,880
amazing resemblance between them

288
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,920
it's like they're twins like looking in

289
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,639
a mirror

290
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,160
they look exactly alike

291
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,720
that's why everyone's getting him but

292
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,760
everybody

293
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,279
thinks that martin stoner

294
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,399
is master tom amazing

295
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,000
anyways let's go ahead and read on

296
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,240
okay moving on the next sentence says

297
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,360
later

298
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
george warned martin that that

299
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,399
michael lay was back in the village

300
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,519
and that he had sworn

301
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,560
to give tom flowers

302
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,920
no no he had sworn to

303
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,399

aunt won't look at him won't talk to him

306
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,839
no one likes him

307
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,480
and this guy michael lay he's back in

308
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,040

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,040
and he has sworn to kill

310
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,160
tom oh man

311
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,279
anyways here if you warn someone of

312
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,160
something

313
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,440
you tell that person that there is some

314
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,680
danger in the future possibly okay

315
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,800
be careful this bad thing might happen

316
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,079

323
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,120

let michael lay stay here then hopefully

343
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,320
he'll leave

344
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,880
well hopefully that will keep martin out

345
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,560
of danger we'll find out

346
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,360
after the break

347
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
down

348
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,040
come

349
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,920
helen gave up her well-paying job to

350
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,279
pursue a life

351
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,639
of helping others

352
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,560
the hounds of fate martin decided not to

353
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,440
return

354
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,759
he had enough money for a fresh start

355
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,880
and as he left

356
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,320
he felt hopeful almost happy however

357
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,880
as he was riding along the road michael

358
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,120
lay stepped out from behind a tree

359
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,320
and shot him dead in the end the hounds

360
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:00,880
of fate

361
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,839
had finally caught up with martin

362
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,400
okay so martin decided not to return

363
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,799
he's not going to stay at the farm or

364
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,919
he's not going to come back

365
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,079
the farm i should say getting out of

366
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,160
town he's had his fill yeah

367
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,720
okay plenty of food plenty of sleep got

368
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,359
that horse

369
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,160
probably probably has the horse there

370
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,240
and he's got some money now from

371
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,760
his aunt so he's not coming back and he

372
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,240
probably won't be killed by that guy

373
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,039
michael lay that's right he decides he's

374
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:35,840
stayed here

375
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,919
long enough things are getting a little

376
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,919
scary he's got this money

377
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,960
it's time to go he had enough money for

378
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,440
a fresh start to start a new life

379
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,280
away from this place and as he left he

380
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,720
felt hopeful

381
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,840
almost happy so he'd come to town with

382
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,559
nothing

383
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,960
as you say he got some rest he got some

384
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,360
food probably a horse a bit of money

385
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,080
so things aren't terrible he's got to go

386
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,480
but

387
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,360
it could be worse so he feels hopeful

388
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,400
almost

389
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
happy all right if you're hopeful this

390
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,480
adjective means you're positive you

391
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,919
feel good about the future you are full

392
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:14,880
of hope

393
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
you think things are okay now and

394
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,039
they're probably going to be better

395
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:19,919
tomorrow

396
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,160
and into the future for example the

397
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:22,960
movie

398
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,679
contains a hopeful message things might

399
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:26,000
be

400
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,320
tough now you might be going through

401
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,039
troubles but all things pass all things

402
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,919
change bad times will turn into good

403
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,360
times eventually

404
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,400
have hope be hopeful so he's feeling

405
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,360
things are good

406
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,919
things are hey he's feeling things are

407
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:42,720
good

408
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,640
things are good yep actually they're not

409
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
however you see as he was writing along

410
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,799
the road thinking those hopeful thoughts

411
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,160
michael lay stepped out from behind a

412
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:56,559
tree

413
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,840
master tom yeah

414
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,880
michael a stepped out from behind a tree

415
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,559
said that menacingly

416
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,160
brandished a firearm and shot him dead

417
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,480
whoa just like that he will he was

418
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
warned that michael lay was out for

419
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,200
blood and sure enough michael lay

420
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,080
ambushed him

421
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,240
surprised him from behind a tree with a

422
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,280
weapon and

423
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
killed him it's just too bad that this

424
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,720
villain here michael lay

425
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,360
didn't like tell him why he was killing

426
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,160
him it's true

427
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,640
sir i'm killing you because of so-and-so

428
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,840
although michael a here i guess he's not

429
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,960
really the villain

430
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,000
anyways in the end the hounds of fate

431
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,480
had finally caught up with martin

432
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,679
anyways what do you

433
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,880
think mike what no what do you think tom

434
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,520
did

435
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,919
that made the people in the community

436
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,000
hate him so much

437
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,200
i'm not sure but tom probably did

438
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,080
something especially bad to michael lay

439
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,640
or his

440
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
family he probably stole their horses

441
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,880
stole their horses i'm thinking maybe he

442
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,640
like promised to marry michael

443
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,720
a's sister and then ran away with her

444
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,200
money leaving her heart broken or

445
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
something like that i don't know

446
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,520
but nothing good nothing good he wasn't

447
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,440

rock and roll

455
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,480
young people today might not understand

456
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,520
why he was so

457
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,280
famous in the 1950s the term rock and

458
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,919
roll

459
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,960
didn't exist yet back then the only

460
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,720
forms of popular music

461
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,000
were country music and the blues elvis

462
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,919
presley did something new

463
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,360
by combining those two styles of music

464
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,080
the new style he played was called rock

465
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,280
and roll

466
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,000
although he didn't invent rock and roll

467
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,919
he did make it popular

468
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,159

fashion

473
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,720
