00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,040
so

00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:28,240
[Music]

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,320
hi everyone this is karen welcome back

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,679
everybody i'm shane

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,840
today we're looking at part two of the

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,520
duck-billed platypus

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,280
the impossible animal and the vocabulary

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,399
words are

10
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,600
dive dive great white sharks can

11
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,320
dive to depths of one thousand and two

12
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,760
hundred meters

13
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,960
electrical electrical one way to produce

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,160
electrical energy is to burn coal

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,199
signal signal in 1977

16
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,920
a scientist received a powerful signal

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,879
from space

18
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,920
that has not been detected since

19
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,680
scoop scoop tom scooped up some rocks

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,119
with his hand

21
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,720
and threw them into the river hmm crush

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,840
crush to make wine the traditional way

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,640
you need to first crush the grapes with

24
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,600
your feet

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,040
chris i guess you don't like wine

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,000
but i like the duck-billed platypus do

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,479
you

28
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,880
because they are really really unique

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,920
they're super

30
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,640
cute right yes they are and but you

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,000
wouldn't think that they're

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,759
meat eaters would you i guess i wouldn't

33
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,680
you're right but they eat they are meat

34
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,200
eaters yeah so they're

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,479
carnivores right they eat meat and they

36
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,240
actually hunt at night under water

37
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,119
under water wow so they're nocturnal

38
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,159
animals they go

39
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,040
underwater but the interesting thing is

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,560
they keep their eyes

41
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,920
and their noses shut right so if they go

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,719
underwater

43
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,280
and their eyes are closed how do they

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
see what they're trying to catch

45
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,280
i think they can send uh they can sense

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,160
the electrical

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,840
what is it what is it the electrical

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,360
signals from that's right

49
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
from like you know maybe like a worm

50
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
underwater tasty worm or something

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,800
like a shellfish and then they would

52
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
just scoop it up with their bill

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,879
and they get all the mud and the rocks

54
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,000
and everything

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,480
then they bring that back to the shore

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,400
and then they'll use those rocks

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,200
to crush things like to shellfish that's

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,879
right so that they can eat the meat out

59
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:31,280
of it

60
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
because they don't have teeth they don't

61
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,879
have meat seeds so they just

62
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,360
swallow it down that's pretty cool such

63
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
an interesting animal i have never heard

64
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,959
of any animals like that

65
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,480
it's pretty cool let's learn more about

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,319
the duck-billed platypus

67
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,800
all right

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,239
the duck-billed platypus the impossible

69
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,280
animal

70
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,959
you might be surprised to learn that

71
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,280
platypuses are meat eaters that hunt for

72
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,200
their food underwater

73
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,760
they like to snack on worms insects and

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,640
shellfish

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,560
and spend up to 12 hours a day on the

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,800
hunt mostly in rivers and wetlands

77
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,840
today's lesson is called the duck-billed

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
platypus

79
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,599
the impossible animal

80
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,640
part two hello everyone i

81
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,680
am jeff and i'm mike and we actually

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,120
know that this title

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,000
isn't really telling us the truth it is

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
a possible animal

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,879
the duckbilled platypus the really weird

86
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,799
animal that exists would be a little

87
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,879
more accurate but it does almost

88
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,440
seem impossible especially when we learn

89
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,120
not i mean not only does it look

90
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,280
strange you can see a picture of it

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,440
there in your magazine i'm sure not only

92
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,799
does it look strange but

93
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,400
we learned yesterday that it actually

94
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,000
has genes from

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,879
all different types of animals mixed in

96
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,000
and this all happened 166 million years

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,400
ago

98
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,120
it almost does seem like nature just

99
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,360
decided to play a joke one day

100
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,879
and said i'm going to make this animal

101
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,519
that totally breaks all the rules but

102
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,000
it's real well it's a unique answer it's

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,040
a very weird

104
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,159
special that followed its very own

105
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,199
unique genetic path to where it is

106
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,680
right in one little corner of the world

107
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,918
one little corner of the world now you

108
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,639
might be surprised to learn

109
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,560
that platypuses are meat eaters

110
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,759
really that hunt for their food

111
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,560
under water ducks use that kind of mouth

112
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,440
to eat

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,600
weeds and grass and stuff they don't

114
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,520
hunt with them not the duck build

115
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,720
platypus

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,400
they like to snack on worms insects and

117
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,600
shellfish and spend up to

118
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,720
12 hours a day on the hunt

119
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,240
mostly in rivers and wetlands

120
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,400
so they hunt most of the time they do

121
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,160
they're busy little animals and of

122
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,160
course they have to probably eat a lot

123
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,960
of those

124
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,400
little worms insects shellfish animals

125
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,759
they might find in

126
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,199
rivers lakes ponds wetlands places like

127
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,000
that so

128
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,160
they spend most of their time in water

129
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,600
they aren't in the ocean

130
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,759
right they're in fresh water rivers and

131
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,120
wetlands not in

132
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,000
seas and oceans giving us an idea of you

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,199
know what they eat

134
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,919
where they live their habitat and their

135
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,680
environment let's take a break and then

136
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,600
we'll be back with more about the

137
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,240
duckbill

138
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:39,840
platypus hello

139
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,440
the duck-billed platypus the impossible

140
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,319
animal

141
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,960
platypuses do their hunting at night

142
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,720
they dive under the water for a minute

143
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,080
or two at a time

144
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,680
paddling with their front feet and

145
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,120
steering with their back feet

146
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,840
and tail while searching for food

147
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,759
strangely during the entire time they

148
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,880
are underwater

149
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,080
their eyes ears and noses are shut tight

150
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,520
so how do they find their food

151
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
okay before the break we learned that

152
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,080
platypuses

153
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,759
hunt they hunt a lot they hunt like

154
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,560
12 hours a day but get this

155
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,680
platypuses do their hunting

156
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,680
at night they are nocturnal

157
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,400
interesting so they're hunting 12 hours

158
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,360
a day

159
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,160
but most of that is actually in the dark

160
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,319
as you say at night so how do they do

161
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,960
this

162
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,880
how do they hunt for those worms and

163
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,560
insects and shellfish in

164
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,680
rivers and wetlands they dive under the

165
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,639
water for a

166
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,680
minute or two at a time paddling with

167
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,960
their front feet

168
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,440
and steering with their back feet and

169
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,160
tail

170
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,440
while searching for food okay well that

171
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,400
sounds kind of

172
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,479
like it would make sense if you look at

173
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
their bodies they have those

174
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,160
those feet for paddling and then the

175
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
back legs and the tail like an otter

176
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,720
do some of the steering or like a beaver

177
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
do some of the steering and of course if

178
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,240
they're eating shellfish and

179
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,080
things like that they will definitely

180
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,160
have to dive what is it to dive

181
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,039
to dive in in the case of a platypus is

182
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,080
basically to go

183
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,639
down in the water so you're swimming in

184
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,280
the water

185
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,039
you see something interesting at the

186
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,879
bottom of the lake or the river

187
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,360
and then you dive down to get it you

188
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,599
could do that if you're swimming or

189
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,400
with people or certain types of birds or

190
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,039
ducks

191
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,520
they might also be outside of the water

192
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,080
and go

193
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,039
head first down into the waters but if

194
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,000
you're in the water

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,640
and you're just moving downwards you're

196
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
diving as well like a shark

197
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,080
great white sharks can dive to depths

198
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,719
of 1200 meters below the surface of the

199
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,440
water wow

200
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,160
they can swim really deep under the

201
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,399
water there but amazing platypuses don't

202
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,600
worry about that

203
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,920
anyways strangely during the entire time

204
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,480
they are

205
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,920
under water their eyes ears

206
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,279
and noses are shut tight

207
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,560
apparently the platypuses don't use

208
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,680
any of their senses in order to hunt

209
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,480
yes they shut their eyes they shut their

210
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,120
ears

211
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,200
and they shut their noses they don't

212
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,160
smell

213
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,640
they don't hear they don't see so how do

214
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,000
they find their food

215
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,040
so how do they find their food that is

216
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,399
the question and we'll

217
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,839
answer that question

218
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,959
right after a break radar we'll see you

219
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,880
after that

220
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,519
mites

221
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
shot

222
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,839
h-e-a-d

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,839
some people listen to music while they

224
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:10,240
study keiji huacha

225
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,560
some people listen to music while

226
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,120
studying

227
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,120
on the hunt

228
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,920
scientists are searching for a cure for

229
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,839
the disease

230
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,240
the duck-billed platypus the impossible

231
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,200
animal

232
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
the answer lies in the platypus's bill

233
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
which can sense tiny electrical signals

234
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
set off by the movements of other living

235
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
creatures

236
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,000
once the platypus senses a tasty worm or

237
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,800
insect

238
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,959
it scoops it up in its bill along with

239
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,079
the surrounding mud

240
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,320
and small stones and heads back to the

241
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,600
surface

242
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,680
there it uses the stones to crush the

243
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,880
food in its mouth

244
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,120
before swallowing it because platypuses

245
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,959
don't have teeth

246
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:23,279
one might say this strange little animal

247
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,160
is living proof

248
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,000
that truth is stranger than fiction

249
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,040
all right let's say i'm hunting in the

250
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,240
water

251
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,200
i would generally keep my eyes open so

252
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
that i can see

253
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,000
sure uh and let's say i could somehow

254
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,880
smell

255
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,440
in the water sharks do shark smell i

256
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,199
would keep my nose open

257
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,120
sure same thing goes with the ears i

258
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,399
would want to hear

259
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,519
the platypus does none of these things

260
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,880
the platypus

261
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,320
closes its eyes nose and ears when

262
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,800
hunting well so how does it find prey

263
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,920
the answer lies in the platypus's

264
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,120
bill oh that big duck-shaped mouth

265
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,279
type thing that it has the thing that

266
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,720
goes quack on a duck

267
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
right well i guess it makes sense it's

268
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,399
hunting at night so the eyes wouldn't

269
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:18,800
work

270
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,279
very well especially in a river and of

271
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,000
course it's an

272
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,399
air-breathing animal so it has to close

273
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,800
its nose and not breathe in water so

274
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,440
yeah

275
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,800
the bill that big mouth part that's how

276
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,519
it hunts

277
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,839
how exactly the answer lies in the

278
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,440
platypus's bill

279
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,480
which can sense tiny electrical

280
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,600
signals set off by the movements of

281
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,880
other living creatures that is

282
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,440
absolutely incredible i think sharks

283
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,240
have something

284
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,399
similar they have sensors down their

285
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,160
whole body which can pick up the

286
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,040
movement

287
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,279
of animals far away so it doesn't have

288
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,959
to see them or smell them but

289
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,519
still electrical signals that it can

290
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,160
sense

291
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,199
humans we don't have any kind of ability

292
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,079
like this

293
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,360
we can't really sense electrical signals

294
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,199
now here electrical means

295
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,440
ever having to do with electricity

296
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,079
but yes we use electricity on a daily

297
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,040
basis

298
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,079
when you plug your phone into the wall

299
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,639
to charge your battery you're using

300
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,639
electricity you've got a device it's an

301
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,160
electrical device

302
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,800
and it charges your phone with

303
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,040
electricity and yes

304
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,639
animals do get let off electrical

305
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,440
signals

306
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,839
and apparently the duckbill platypus is

307
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:40,560
able to

308
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,759
pick up on them how cool is that for

309
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,800
example

310
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,839
one way to produce electrical energy

311
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,240
is to burn coal it's not a clean way of

312
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,399
making electricity but

313
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,360
you can make electrical energy in that

314
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,839
way

315
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,320
anyway let's move on the next vocabulary

316
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,120
word

317
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,360
is the word signal that's right what is

318
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
a signal basically a

319
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,440
signal is some kind of energy that

320
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,160
carries

321
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,120
data or information when we think of

322
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,600
signals the easiest thing to think of is

323
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,320
how your cell phone works or how a radio

324
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,959
works

325
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,880
there are those radio waves coming

326
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,360
around there are the cell phone towers

327
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,720
sending signals or wi-fi or internet

328
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,399
things like that and you have some

329
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,480
machine that can turn that

330
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,279
energy in the air into some kind of

331
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,600
information into the noise coming from a

332
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,320
radio

333
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,880
into the call or the email that comes to

334
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,839
your phone

335
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,759
or something like that so it's that

336
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,079
energy out there that's carrying data or

337
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,920
information of some kind for example in

338
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,399
1977

339
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,600
a scientist received a powerful signal

340
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,000
from

341
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,199
space that has not been detected

342
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,639
since wow what was that could have been

343
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,519
aliens or it could have just been a star

344
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,240
letting off

345
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,959
energy in some kind of unusual way

346
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,000
or a space traveling duck build platypus

347
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,799
no it wasn't not likely no it wasn't it

348
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:15,119
could

349
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,480
that would actually be impossible okay

350
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,000
once the platypus senses a tasty wormer

351
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,240
insect not in space it scoops it up and

352
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:26,640
it's

353
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,520
built along with the surrounding mud and

354
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,600
small stones

355
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,039
and heads back to the surface by the way

356
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,160
to scoop is to pick something

357
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,760
up with a circular kind of a circular

358
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,200
spoon like

359
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,480
entity so here that bill it might have a

360
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,039
bit of a

361
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,919
circular surface on it and it can scoop

362
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,280
up this stuff

363
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,600
pick it up almost like a shovel then

364
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,640
take it back

365
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,760
to the surface for example tom

366
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,720
scooped up some rocks with his hand and

367
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,640
threw them into the river he turned his

368
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,280
hand

369
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,039
into something that kind of looks like a

370
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:06,960
bowl or a spoon

371
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,919
picked those up and then threw them in

372
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:10,640
to

373
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,000
the river now what does it do

374
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,960
once it gets to the shore there well

375
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,640
remember it's picked up the

376
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,039
insect or the the shellfish or whatever

377
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,280
along with some stones from the bottom

378
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,960
of that river and there

379
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,880
up at the surface up at the top of the

380
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,799
water where of course it can breathe

381
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,600
again

382
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,720
there it uses the stones to crush

383
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,400
the food in its mouth before swallowing

384
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:36,799
it

385
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,320
because platypuses don't have teeth

386
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
when you crush something basically you

387
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,240
put a lot of pressure on it you

388
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,960
smash it you pound it from some larger

389
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,640
shape into smaller and smaller and

390
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,600
smaller shapes

391
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,080
we use our teeth to crush especially

392
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,240
hard foods if you put nuts

393
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,160
into your mouth you don't bite them and

394
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,919
cut them in half with the front part of

395
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,640
your

396
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,640
your teeth you put them into the back

397
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,160
with those big teeth and you

398
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,880
smash them in between into small pieces

399
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,240
that is what it is to

400
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,400
crush something here's another thing we

401
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,440
might crush but

402
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,840
with our feet to make wine the

403
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,039
traditional way

404
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,520
you need to first crush the grapes with

405
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,480
your feet

406
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,960
or with a great press a machine that

407
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,240
pushes down on them

408
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,039
and crushes them into a small tiny

409
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,400
pieces

410
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,240
there you have it getting the juice out

411
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
anyways let's go ahead and wrap

412
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,280
up our article one might say this

413
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,400
strange little animal is living proof

414
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,360
that truth is stranger than fiction

415
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,960
i couldn't have possibly said it better

416
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,240
myself all right folks it's time to ask

417
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,280
the one

418
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,919
question mike which fact or facts about

419
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,120
platypuses

420
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,640
did you find the most surprising well i

421
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,960
still think that it's surprising that

422
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,960
the platypus can also be

423
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,600
poisonous we didn't really get into that

424
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,400
but yeah

425
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,640
the males have these little spurs these

426
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,039
little pointy things on their back legs

427
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:09,840
i believe

428
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,240
that apparently very poisonous to human

429
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,200
beings i mean

430
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,120
i don't know why that would be what do

431
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,640
they use them for well

432
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
we'll have to leave that for another day

433
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,000
but for an animal full

434
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,200
of surprises it's pretty easy to find a

435
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,320
surprising fact

436
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,679
because a platypus is basically just one

437
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,960
surprising fact after another in a 50

438
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,400
centimeter package

439
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,120
i agree all right folks it's time for us

440
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,400
to say bye bye

441
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,600
we'll see you next time

442
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
on

443
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,840
scoop

444
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,269
[Music]

445
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,760
my

446
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,039
there are over 700 different species of

447
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,960
eucalyptus trees

448
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,960
these trees make up nearly

449
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,000
three-quarters

450
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,600
of the forests in australia koalas live

451
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,039
in eucalyptus trees

452
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,320
and only eat eucalyptus leaves

453
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,520
eucalyptus trees are both good and bad

454
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,480
for forest fires in australia they can

455
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,280
grow back

456
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,640
in a few months after the fires go out

457
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,360
the oil inside of them makes it easier

458
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,919
for them to catch on fire though

459
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,080
some countries have banned eucalyptus

460
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,200
from growing to prevent fires

461
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,320
eucalyptus wood is often called gumnut

462
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,120
the oil is used in many beauty products

463
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,600
and

464
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,159
some natural medicines some of the

465
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,840
things that eucalyptus

466
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,120
helps with are coughs and joint pain

467
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,760
it's also used in perfumes because it

468
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,840
has a particular smell

469
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,320
since the various types of eucalyptus

470
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,120
trees grow

471
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,840
all over the world the oil has been used

472
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,960
by people for

473
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,440
thousands of years let's go climb a

474
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,559
eucalyptus tree

475
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,480
and see the view from up there when

476
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,720

trees treatment

482
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,200
the best treatments for a cold are to

rest

484
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,000
and drink more water haze

485
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,320
the mountains were surrounded by the

486
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,080

487
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,039

are all insects surface

492
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,520
the leaves floated on the surface of the

493
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,120
water

494
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,640
toxin toxins in the water

495
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,480
made people sick soil

496
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,480
