Jeff and I'm Mike now my Orca might not

59
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,450
be a name that is familiar to you but if

60
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,519
we tell you that it is part of the

61
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,609
country of Spain ah now you probably

62
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:17,790
have a much better idea of where in the

63
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,579
world we are my Orca yeah it's an island

64
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:23,129
or it's one of several islands off the

65
00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:25,650
coast of Spain in the beautiful

twister or to Majorca if you want to get

72
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:45,000
even deeper into things in Spain it's

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,370
not an island so Spain is not an island

74
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,530
though it's a peninsula it's actually a

75
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,260
part of the Iberian Peninsula but yes my

30% of the islands territory which makes

139
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,180
it a cyclists dream the steep curving

140
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,100
roads that cross the tall peaks and

141
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,260
rocky cliffs provide some of the most

142
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,180
challenging cycling on the island in

143
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,820

so I'm only going on the little bit that

151
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,280
I know so let's find out more about my

152
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,530
Orca because then I'm sure we will all

153
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,290
be fans and some of us will be booking

154
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,000
our tickets it says since it is a

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,630
relatively small island Majorca is best

156
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,330
seen by bicycle well that's great you

157
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,430
don't have to rent a car you can see

158
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,170
that see the whole island from the back

159
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,810
of a bike and get some exercise at the

160
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,310
same time yeah they say the same thing

161
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,100
about LAN you here off the coast of

162
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,440
Taiwan it's a small enough island that

163
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,990
you can get around by bicycle you can go

164
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:48,150
you can go all the way around the island

165
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,490
and one day no problem on a bike so why

166
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,470
aren't a car or a scooter if you don't

167
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,660
have to anyways here it says that

168
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,720
Majorca is a relatively small island

169
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,970
what are we saying we're saying compared

170
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,220
to other islands it's quite small like

171
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,040
Taiwan is a very large island you

172
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,680
probably couldn't bike around it in one

173
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,890
day but compared to Taiwan LAN U is a

174
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,260
relatively small island it is small

175
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,180
compared to something else that's what

176
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,550
this adverb relatively means in this

177
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,760
case for example compared to most years

178
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,140
this winter has been relatively warm

179
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,640
compared to other years this has been a

180
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,520
warm season on average the temperatures

181
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,900
were warmer than you would expect

182
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,150
alright so let's imagine we're on our

183
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,280
bikes we're traveling around my Orca

184
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,590
taking in some of the sights what would

185
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,900
we see it says visera

186
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,470
detriment Anna mountain range runs along

187
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:46,130
the island's northwestern coast and

188
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,650
covers nearly 30% of the islands

189
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,530
territory which makes it a cyclists

190
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,540
dreams it dreams it to dream on the way

191
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,270
down on the way up maybe not so much but

192
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,880
all the way down fun or maybe park your

193
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,590
bike in the morning do some hiking in

194
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,900
the mountain ranges and then cycle back

195
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,930
to town downhill but there are beautiful

196
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,940
mountains there so it's not just sort of

197
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,600
beaches

198
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,000
you know seaside you can definitely get

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,130
up into this Serra tum tana there you go

200
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,440
that's the mountain range now the steep

201
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,590
curving roads that cross the tall peaks

202
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,410
and rocky cliffs provides some of the

203
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,620
most challenging cycling on the island

204
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,600
so there you go it's a cyclists dream

205
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,020
let's say you like those really really

206
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,360
hard steep mountains

207
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,550
that's the steep mountain roads I should

208
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,530
say you're gonna love this but for

209
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,390
someone like me or maybe Mike there

210
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,130
maybe it's just a dream and we're

211
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,890
coasting downhill because it does sound

212
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,140
like this is going to be some

213
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,420
challenging cycling there on my Yorkin

214
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,460
anyways we've got three vocabulary words

215
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,920
to cover right now next up we have the

216
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,780
word steep that's right when you're

217
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,150
recycling if you're riding up a steep

218
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,670
hill you'll be working very hard your

219
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,650
leg muscles will be getting a really

220
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,300
good workout and you'll probably be

221
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,060
going slowly because steep means at a

222
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,420
very high angle it's definitely not flat

223
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,360
and it's not a small rise it's quite a

224
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,730
quick rise so you're going up at a high

225
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,920
angle of course if you're riding down a

226
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,770
steep hill that's much easier you

227
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,110
probably won't have to work at all but

228
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,330
you might be going quite fast at the

229
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,310
bottom so steep means at a high angle

230
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,690
and then when we're thinking about

231
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:33,330
mountain climbing or hiking walking or

232
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,700
riding up a steep hill would be much

233
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,800
harder than walking or riding on a

234
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,710
flatland for example my grandpa had

235
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,200
trouble climbing the steep stairs

236
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,630
anyways we also said that these roads

237
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:49,260
are curving or curvy if something is

238
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,140
curving or we call it curving or curvy

239
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:56,610
it's not straight like curly hair is not

240
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:59,880
straight hair it might be as far as this

241
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,460
curly road is concerned it might Bend

242
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,370
around a certain thing or something else

243
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,090
like that

244
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,460
for example the road curves to the left

245
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,250
after the post office so notice in the

246
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,020
example sentence we've used this word as

247
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,800
a verb okay curvy lines curving lines

248
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,440
aren't straight if you curve you follow

249
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,830
that curvy path next up we also have the

250
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,310
word

251
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,800
- talking yes a cliff is a natural

252
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,110
feature of the landscape it's basically

253
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,270
where a part of the land has dropped

254
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,640
down very quickly maybe because of an

255
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,279
earthquake or weather erosion or

256
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,480
something like that and you have

257
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,540
basically a wall of rock that would be a

258
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,670
cliff you have standing at the top of

259
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,380
the cliff if you look down between your

260
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:46,140
toes you'll see the ground of far below

261
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,600
you it's dangerous of course standing on

262
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,730
the edge of a cliff but if you're a rock

263
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,100
climber maybe climbing up the face or

264
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,020
the front of the cliff would be an

265
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,850
exciting challenge but it's something

266
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:59,160
that you'll see out in nature where some

267
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,290
land has dropped down very quickly and

268
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,480
you have basically a very steep rock

269
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,480
wall for example Tim stood at the edge

270
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,760
of the cliff and took a picture

271
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,100
be careful Tim it was a hopefully he

272
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,660
wasn't taking a selfie while leaning

273
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,380
over the cliff bad bad idea by the way

274
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,810
off and cliffs fall straight into the

275
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:21,380
water there or - into the ocean so

276
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,240
really be careful okay don't fall off a

277
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,610
cliff the water is there but it probably

278
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,580
won't break your fall anyways let's go

279
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,620
ahead and finish up this part of our

280
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,170
lesson the next sentence says in fact

281
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,460
the roads are often used as practice for

282
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,490
the tour the falls by professional

283
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:44,339
cyclists so this is a cyclists heaven

284
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,200
okay you've got mountains and stuff like

285
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,740
that

286
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,890
well how demanding is the cycling going

287
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,210
to be there apparently

288
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,630
it's tough enough demanding enough and

289
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,130
challenging enough that professional

290
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:59,010
cyclists practice for the Tour de France

291
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:01,440
there by the way the most important

292
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,200
biking race or bike bicycling race in

293
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,430
the world is called the Tour de France

294
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,589
and apparently these professional

295
00:13:07,589 --> 00:13:09,839
cyclists they practice here in Majorca

296
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,330
because the mountains there are perfect

297
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,520
for practice apparently now here we've

298
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,670
got professional cyclists I can call

299
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,250
myself a cyclist but I don't get paid

300
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,910
money to ride a bicycle around ok I'm an

301
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,970
amateur cyclists professional cyclists

302
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,180
get paid to ride their bikes and to race

303
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,730
their bikes against other cyclists for

304
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,190
example Nelson's cousin is a

305
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,810
professional dance

306
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,870
this person gets paid to dance okay and

307
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,370
of course we would only use this for

308
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:44,430
jobs or activities but you could do as a

309
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:46,980
hobby you would never say my friend is a

310
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,650
professional doctor because there are no

311
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,190
amateur doctors that's just weird but a

312
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,290
professional musician a professional

313
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:58,110
dancer a professional chef or something

314
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,300
like that shows you that this person is

315
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,310
doing it at a high level and they're

316
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,290
getting paid money it's their job

317
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,880
all right let's take a break we'll be

318
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,490
getting our bikes out maybe not no and

319
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,290
then we'll be back after this to find
